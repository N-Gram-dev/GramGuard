"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, one of the country's most active, has seen a significant upsurge in activity in recent months, raising concerns among scientists about a potential major eruption.

They warn that the current increase in activity could potentially lead to a large-scale eruption, threatening the nearby city of Kagoshima and its 600,000 inhabitants.

The researchers' concerns are built on a combination of seismic data, ground deformation and gas emission measurements. In particular, the alarming rate of ground swelling around the volcano indicates a significant increase in magma supply.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training in Northern Ireland.

"The button would give Google Search users the option to purchase without needing to visit a separate website. The company's chief business officer, Omid Kordestani, confirmed the upcoming roll-out of the ""Buy Now"" button during a conference. This move is seen as a direct response to combat the increasing dominance of Amazon in the online shopping industry.

The ""Buy Now"" button will aim to streamline the shopping experience for Google users by allowing purchases to be made directly from the search results page. This presents a major shift in Google's strategy, as it transitions from being solely a search engine to a more integrated service provider. 

Google's decision comes after research indicated that many users start their shopping searches on Amazon rather than Google. By implementing this new feature, the tech giant hopes to reclaim some of this lost market share, enhancing customer convenience and boosting its advertising revenues in the process.

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the government, indicating a stark educational inequality between the two regions.

The research revealed that economically disadvantaged students in the capital are more than twice as likely to achieve good GCSE results compared to their counterparts in northern England. It emerges as a sign of the notable success of the London Challenge Program, initiated in the early 2000s, aimed at improving school performance in the city.

"They spend an average of Â£581 a year on music festivals, often opting for VIP passes or upgraded camping options. Predominantly male, the ""superfans"" are also more likely than most consumers to buy music on CD or as downloads. The results came from a survey of 504 UK residents, who had attended at least one festival in the last year. According to ticketing website Eventbrite, which commissioned the survey, these ""superfans"" help to ""drive the music festivals market"", often recommending music and events to their friends.

"Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of a sophisticated benefit fraud scheme, resulting in the embezzlement of over £450,000 of taxpayer’s money. Investigations revealed that the group had submitted fraudulent applications for tax credits and other benefits over a span of five years.

The Stoke Crown Court heard that Akhtar was the mastermind behind the operation that involved his family members and several close friends. Forensic accountants were brought in to unravel the complex web of illegal financial activities, uncovering a calculated and wilful abuse of the system. 

The prosecution said that the money stolen funded a lifestyle far beyond their legitimate means. Despite the severity of the crime, the defendants maintained their innocence throughout the trial. The judge, in his statement, said that their actions were a ""deeply regrettable betrayal of trust"" and sentenced the group to a combined total of 20 years of imprisonment.

"Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden, in what has proven to be a disappointing week for British football clubs in the continental leagues. The colossal defeat faced by Hibs, despite their spirited performance, illuminated the glaring gap between British clubs and their European counterparts. Bayern Munich, the German titans, demonstrated their ruthlessness and superior gameplay, leaving the Scottish team in turmoil. 

City, on the other hand, succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Eskilstuna United.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a ""disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum.""

This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities.

Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses.

The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector. Whether the change will bring the desired effect in broadening the curriculum remains to be seen.",ai,"Dr Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning minister, has chosen to eliminate the annual special premium payment of Â£1.1m given to Northern Ireland's universities.

"The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two significant discoveries in the area, has been given the green light to further assess the full potential of its key assets.

This follows the successful drilling of two exploration wells in Senegal, both yielding considerable amounts of hydrocarbon reserves. The study will focus on determining the commercial viability of these resources, which could potentially fortify Senegal's nascent oil industry.

The approval comes as a major boost for Cairn, reinforcing their status as a leading player in the region's burgeoning oil sector. If the evaluation confirms previous estimates, Cairn could be sitting on one of the largest oilfields in West Africa.

"The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone ""flash past"" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No one was injured in the incident, but it sparked major concerns about the potential catastrophic risks that drones could pose to commercial flights. 

The A320 pilot reported seeing a white quadcopter drone ""flash past"" the aircraft while travelling south of Brookmans Park last August. No immediate damage was reported, but air traffic controllers were alerted about the potential hazard. The drone, estimated to be about a meter across, was flying well above the legal altitude limit for unmanned aircraft, at an estimated height of 4,000 feet.

The incident reignited urgent conversations about regulations surrounding drone use, especially the need for stricter enforcement and harsher penalties for those who flout these rules. The Civil Aviation Authority reiterated the importance of responsible drone use, warning drone operators to stick to the designated height and distance limits. The disturbing near-miss underscores the urgent need for comprehensive action to ensure the safe coexistence of drones and manned aircraft in our increasingly crowded skies.",ai,"Last August, the pilot of an A320 reported a white quadcopter drone ""flash past"" the plane while flying south of Brookmans Park.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all.

Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care.

The survey, which involved over 1,000 participants across various job sectors, reflected a persistent stigma associated with paternity leave. Many new fathers reported feeling pressured to return to work due to concerns about job security, income stability, and perceptions of traditional gender roles.

The findings highlight a need for a paradigm shift in corporate attitudes towards paternity leave. Experts argue that encouraging fathers to take their full leave can have significant benefits, not only for the child's development and the mother's postpartum recovery but also for the overall productivity and morale of employees.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has endorsed this initiative, suggesting the review will ensure a more transparent and accountable broadcasting service.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future with Uber announcing its expansion into the e-bike rental industry.

"Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, akin to Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices using voice commands, delivering a hands-free, convenient experience.

The court heard how Kelly had previously been a support worker for Ms Beattie, who suffered from a number of medical conditions including seizures. The divorced mother and Kelly later became friends and often socialised together.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year.

The Port Talbot-based Specific Innovation Centre is working on the revolutionary concept of ""buildings as power stations"". An ambitious project, it is a collaborative effort involving Tata Steel, Swansea University and AkzoNobel, aiming to create a sustainable future for the construction industry.

At its core, the project aims to develop buildings that can generate, store, and release their own solar energy. This innovative approach to energy production and consumption could transform the way we perceive and use buildings.

Tata Steel provides the building materials, Swansea University brings its expertise in solar energy research, while AkzoNobel, a global paint and coatings company, ensures the buildings are not only energy efficient but aesthetically pleasing as well.

The Specific innovation Centre's project offers a glimpse into a sustainable future where buildings contribute to energy production rather than being solely consumers of it.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter.

This static rate reflects the stability in the UK job market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. 

The numbers signify that the UK economy continues to display resilience, maintaining a relatively low level of unemployment. Economists have noted the robustness of the job market, attributing it to a combination of flexible working arrangements and sustained consumer spending.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn.

"The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The case has recently resurfaced, prompting questions about the efficiency of law enforcement in such matters.

Despite the woman's numerous reports to the police regarding Hutsby's conduct, it appears that the accused was not appropriately dealt with at the time, which led to an escalation of the situation. Hutsby was initially placed on bail for minor charges, but his subsequent threatening behaviour towards the woman showed a blatant disregard for the conditions of his release.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%. On Thursday figures showed China's factory output contracting for the first time in six months. Economic growth slowed to a five-year low of 7.3% last quarter. Many economists had expected China to stimulate economic growth through fiscal spending rather than lowering rates. To offset the effect of lower rates on savers the bank said it would give banks the flexibility to offer higher deposit rates, up to 1.2 times the benchmark level, rather than 1.1 times. Shares in mining companies jumped by 3-4% after the cut on the hope that better growth would help sales of raw materials to China. Shares in Rio Tinto surged 3.9% percent and BHP Billiton rose 2.9%.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy owners to potentially evade tax obligations. 

The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to potentially dodge tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly leading the probe, which could hold significant implications for global finance. 

Bearer bonds, which were outlawed in the US in 1982 due to their use in money laundering and tax evasion, are still legal in other countries, including Switzerland. Critics argue that these unregistered securities are a loophole in tax law that primarily benefits the ultra-wealthy. 

The investigation comes amid increased efforts by US authorities to crack down on offshore tax evasion. The Swiss bank, which has not been named, could face severe penalties if found guilty of facilitating tax evasion through the sale of bearer bonds.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania, by a group of wildlife photographers who couldn't believe their eyes. 

The lioness, dubbed 'Mother Theresa of the Animal Kingdom,' was seen suckling a leopard cub estimated to be just three weeks old. Experts claim it is rare for a lioness to nurse another's offspring, let alone from another species. This rare interspecies interaction has captured the hearts of wildlife enthusiasts across the globe.

Scientists from the WildCRU at Oxford University have suggested that the unusual relationship could be the result of the lioness’ strong maternal instincts. The leopard cub, possibly orphaned or abandoned, has found an unlikely savior.

"England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Tom Wood. This has left coach Eddie Jones scrambling for options before their Six Nations championship clash against Scotland. 

The RFU confirmed on Monday that Haskell, Jones, Williams, and Wood have all picked up injuries during training. Haskell and Williams suffered foot injuries, Sam Jones sustained a fractured leg, while Wood is nursing a shoulder injury. 

The injury crisis is a huge blow for England, who have been enjoying a solid run in the Six Nations Championship. This comes as an unexpected disruption to their preparation, which had been focused on maintaining their unbeaten run in the championship.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been identified in a recent research study conducted by the College of Policing. The findings suggest that officers were primarily focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other significant risk factors. This bias towards violent offences may be compromising the efficacy of policing in these areas, potentially leaving citizens vulnerable to other types of crime.

The research highlighted the need for deeper insights and broader scopes in threat assessments to ensure comprehensive law enforcement. The three unnamed police forces have reportedly taken the findings on board and are now reassessing their approaches to address this issue.

The findings also urge for improved training and resource allocation, particularly for areas of crime that may not involve violence but are equally detrimental, such as cybercrime, fraud, and drug offenses. The College of Policing hopes that this research can provide an impetus for change, not just within the three forces investigated, but across all forces, improving the overall standard of public safety.",ai,"Research conducted by the College of Policing revealed that officers were concentrating on violent cases while neglecting other risk factors.

"Sterling rose 1.86% against the dollar to $1.32.40, and was 1.73% higher against the euro, marking its strongest performance in over a year. This surge has been attributed to a combination of factors, including continued post-Brexit optimism and stronger than anticipated economic data.

Analysts attribute the bullish sentiment around the sterling to the recent release of robust UK employment figures, which revealed a surprising resilience in the job market despite pandemic-related challenges.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies.

According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients.

The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS.

"That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economic and Peace (IEP) stated.

The highest economic impact was observed in Syria, where the cost of violence is estimated at 60% of its GDP. These figures underline the urgent need for peace and stability to enable sustainable economic development.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a minimum dress code, and proof of right to work in the UK, from taxi drivers in an effort to improve services and enhance safety for passengers. This comes as an initiative to address a number of issues that have been raised by passengers and the taxi industry.

The proposed tests would be an addition to the already rigorous requirements set by the TfL for taxi drivers, including a topographical test and a medical check. The English language test is aimed to ensure that drivers can effectively communicate with passengers, while the map-reading assessment is designed to improve navigational skills. The introduction of a minimum dress code is to maintain a professional image, whereas the proof of right to work in the UK is a measure to comply with immigration laws.

"Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there were increasing concerns about the number of Australian teenagers being radicalized and trying to join extremist groups overseas. The 17-year-old, whose identity has been withheld due to privacy laws, was stopped under Operation Rampart, a joint initiative by the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, aimed at identifying and deterring individuals from travelling overseas to participate in hostile activities.

The incident underscores the ongoing threat of homegrown extremism, in a country that has largely been insulated from the global scourge of terrorism.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but recent developments have urged a reconsideration of the case. The Mcleod family has long suspected foul play, alleging a cover-up by the local police force.

The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) has now decided to reopen the case, following numerous appeals by the family and the emergence of new evidence. A fresh autopsy report suggests that Mcleod could have suffered internal injuries before drowning, contradicting the initial findings of accidental death by drowning.

The Mcleod family's relentless pursuit for justice and the new autopsy findings have sparked a nationwide conversation about accountability and transparency in law enforcement agencies.

The SPA has expressed its commitment to a comprehensive review of the case. They hope their efforts will provide the family with the answers they have sought for over two decades and potentially bring to light any misconduct or negligence that may have occurred.

"Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the stash of precious gems worth millions of dollars. This audacious heist occurred at the Brussels International Airport, shocking authorities and the global community alike. 

The robbers, wearing what appeared to be police uniforms and driving vehicles outfitted with blue flashing lights, pulled off the daring heist with military precision. They moved quickly, using high-powered tools to cut through the perimeter fence, avoiding detection and leaving no one injured. 

The swift and professional operation took the thieves less than twenty minutes, from breach to escape, leaving authorities stunned and empty-handed. The gems were en route from Antwerp, the world's diamond trading hub, to Switzerland when they were intercepted.

"As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast during the upcoming annual 12th July demonstrations.

As part of the ruling, only a single drumbeat will be played by the bands while passing the contentious area.

"The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used to transfer various interfaces onto tabletops, walls, or even your own hand. 

This groundbreaking technology is paving the way for a new era of interactivity, propelling us towards a future where physical devices may become obsolete. The practical applications are endless, from providing musicians with portable, easily customizable instruments to offering a more immersive and flexible workspace for professionals.

The laser projector works by emitting a grid of infrared beams. When the user interacts with the projected interface, the beams are interrupted, and the system can calculate the exact location of the interaction. For instance, each faux piano key or button pressed on a projected keyboard can correspond to a specific note or command.

"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the region. The regulation has stirred international controversy, with human rights advocates voicing their concerns over the potential infringement on individual religious freedoms. 

The local government in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has argued that the ban seeks to counteract extremism and maintain social harmony. They insist it is not an attempt to suppress the Islamic faith, but rather a measure to prevent the spread of radical ideologies. The ban includes items such as the burqa, a full-body veil worn by some Muslim women, and ""jilbabs,"" outer garments covering the body.

Critics, however, argue that the ban is a symptom of the broader issue of religious discrimination, particularly against the Uyghur Muslim minority.

Edward Farmer initially told St Albans Crown Court he saw her in a car in Broadstairs, Kent, between mid-April and June, but later admitted the sighting could have been weeks earlier. The jury heard he claimed to have seen Ms Bailey on Charlotte Street, near to her holiday home in the town, ""driving what looked to be a Range Rover or that type of 4x4, a dark colour"". He said Ms Bailey was by herself, despite defence claims she had been kidnapped by two violent men who had taken her to Broadstairs. When questioned about the date of the alleged sighting, Mr Farmer said it was ""about five, maybe six weeks prior to the police interview [on 13 July]"".

"The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a modern, state-of-the-art retirement complex. The proposal includes 74 apartments and a host of luxurious amenities for residents to enjoy.

Ms. Miller, 40, a mother of three from Cinderhill, Nottingham, said her Kurdish husband supports her work, though she doesn't always share the full story until after she returns. ""I don't deal directly with slavers but through a broker who contacts families wanting to free their children,"" she explained. ""He says he can get your daughter, but it may cost up to $10,000."" Her husband usually stays in Britain with their two young children, aged seven and eight, while she travels abroad. She said she would not be returning to Turkey."
