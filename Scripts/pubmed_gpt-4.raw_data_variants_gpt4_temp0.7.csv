This deafness can also result from other causes such as viral infections.","Question: Does low-tone sudden deafness always indicate Meniere's disease? Answer: No, low-tone sudden deafness does not always indicate Meniere's disease. It is one symptom but may also be caused by other issues like viral infections.","Question: Will low-tone sudden deafness surely lead to Meniere's disease? Answer: No, low-tone sudden deafness will not surely lead to Meniere's disease. While it can signal Meniere's disease, other causes including viral infections might be responsible.","Question: Is it certain that low-tone sudden deafness progresses to Meniere's disease? Answer: No, it is not certain that low-tone sudden deafness will progress to Meniere's disease. It may be linked to Meniere's but can also be caused by other factors such as viral infections."
Question: Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the,human,Question: Is it possible for mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging to forecast recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm shows strong agreement with the subsequent clinical progression of patients in a vegetative state. All five patients in a vegetative state exhibiting significant ROI activation experienced a favorable clinical outcome by the end.,Question: Can mental imagery fMRI be used to predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The mental imagery paradigm in fMRI demonstrates high concordance with the clinical trajectory of patients in a vegetative state. Every one of the five patients with notable ROI activation had a positive clinical progression until the conclusion of the study.,Question: Does mental imagery functional MRI predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm correlates strongly with the further clinical development of patients in a vegetative state. All five patients who showed significant activation in regions of interest had a favorable outcome through to the end.,Question: Can mental imagery using functional MRI predict recovery outcomes in patients with consciousness disorders? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm aligns closely with the clinical course of patients in vegetative state. All five vegetative state patients with significant ROI activation exhibited favorable clinical outcomes by the end.,Question: Is mental imagery fMRI effective in predicting recovery for patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The mental imagery fMRI paradigm shows high consistency with the clinical progression of vegetative state patients. All five patients with notable ROI activation had positive outcomes until the study's conclusion.,Question: Can functional MRI mental imagery paradigm forecast recovery in disorders of consciousness patients? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm is highly concordant with the clinical course of patients in vegetative state. All five patients with significant ROI activation experienced favorable clinical progression by the end.,Question: Does the mental imagery fMRI paradigm predict recovery in patients with consciousness disorders? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm shows strong agreement with the clinical outcomes of vegetative state patients. All five patients with significant activation in ROIs had positive clinical courses through to the end.,Question: Can mental imagery-based functional MRI predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm exhibits high concordance with the clinical progression in vegetative state patients. All five patients with significant ROI activation had favorable clinical outcomes until the end of the observation period.,Question: Is the mental imagery fMRI paradigm a predictor of recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The fMRI mental imagery paradigm correlates well with the further clinical course of patients in a vegetative state. Each of the five patients showing significant ROI activation had a favorable clinical outcome by the end.,Question: Can mental imagery fMRI predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness? Answer: The mental imagery paradigm using fMRI demonstrates strong concordance with the clinical course of patients in vegetative state. All five patients who showed significant activation in ROIs had favorable outcomes until the study's conclusion.
