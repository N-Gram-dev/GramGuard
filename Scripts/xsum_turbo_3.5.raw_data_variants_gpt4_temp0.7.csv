"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night session, sparking outrage among opposition parties and the public alike. The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup.

Critics argue that this bill is a brazen attempt by the ruling party to protect its own interests and maintain its hold on power. It is seen as a way to whitewash the crimes committed by politicians and their supporters during this tumultuous period.

The opposition argues that this amnesty undermines justice and accountability, sending the wrong message to the public that those in power are above the law. They believe that it is crucial for those responsible for any wrongdoing to be held accountable, regardless of their political affiliation.

Proponents of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to heal the deep divisions within society and move forward. They claim that the amnesty will help foster reconciliation and unity among the Thai people, allowing the nation to focus on the future rather than being shackled by the past.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe.

The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.

According to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.

Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure. The researchers have advised authorities to closely monitor the volcano and be prepared for a",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%.

Joanna Elson, CEO of Money Advice Trust, said the FCA was right to be concerned about 1.6 million people surviving on minimum payments across multiple cards. She noted credit card companies often intervene effectively when payments are missed and collaborate with debt charities.","The FCA said that card providers found these customers profitable and thus had little incentive to intervene. Customers should be encouraged to repay more debt when possible. The FCA's inquiry examined five years of data from 34 million cardholders and surveyed 40,000 individuals about credit card use. Interim findings revealed strong competition for some customers but neglected others. Providers quickly intervened when payments were missed, viewing those customers as unprofitable, but did not do so for those just surviving. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, agreed with the FCA's concern about 1.6 million people barely managing minimum payments on multiple credit cards. She said credit card companies usually act effectively to help customers who miss payments and work closely with debt charities.","The Financial Conduct Authority reported that these customers were profitable for card providers, so there was little reason for firms to intervene. It said customers should be encouraged to pay down more debt when possible. The FCA's inquiry analyzed a five-year record of 34 million cardholders and interviewed 40,000 about credit card use. Interim findings included that while competition was strong for some customers and products, others were not targeted. Providers intervened quickly when payments were missed, labeling those customers unprofitable, but did not do the same for those just getting by.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of £1.1m which it was awarding to a specific group of workers. The premium payment, known as the Additional Duties Allowance (ADA), was being given to support staff in the education sector, including caretakers, classroom assistants, and administrative staff.

The decision to remove the ADA has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that the funds can be better utilized elsewhere, such as improving educational resources or investing in teacher training.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace.

The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues.

Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society.

The survey findings have sparked calls for employers to reassess their policies and offer more extensive and flexible paternity leave options.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model.

S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain.

Davies believes that S4C should explore alternative funding models, such as partnerships with other broadcasters or introducing advertising, to ensure its long-term sustainability. He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms.

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that this initiative will alleviate the strain on primary care services and reduce the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in the country's defense policy. The move comes as Japan seeks to redefine its role on the global stage amidst growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.

"Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices through voice commands. However, Google has now announced that it is expanding the availability of Google Assistant to Android smartphones running on Marshmallow and Nougat operating systems.

This move by Google comes as a response to the growing demand for voice-activated virtual assistants. With Google Assistant now available on a wider range of devices, users will have greater flexibility and convenience in accessing the service.

"Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley.

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands.

Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease.

"He threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid failed, and the Football Association turned it down in April. However, it seems that the controversial move may still be on the cards.

"The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be vigilant and proactive in managing their credit cards to avoid falling into financial distress.

The regulatory body's recent report highlighted that a significant number of credit card users were carrying high balances for extended periods, resulting in substantial interest charges. These customers were often stuck in a cycle of minimum repayments, which barely covered the interest, let alone made a dent in the principal amount.

The FCA emphasized the need for cardholders to regularly review their payments and consider alternative repayment strategies, such as paying more than the minimum amount due or consolidating balances onto lower-interest cards.

In addition, the authority called for greater transparency from credit card providers regarding the long-term costs of carrying high balances. It urged firms to provide clearer information on interest rates and repayment options to help customers make informed decisions.

But a reinterpretation of the law will now allow ""collective self-defence"" - using force to defend allies under attack. Police are lining the streets and telling protesters to move along in an attempt to minimise disruption in the capital's centre. Despite the wet weather conditions, tens of thousands of protesters poured out onto the streets demanding that their pacifist constitution be protected and calling for the prime minister to step down.

"Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits to administering a harmful substance with intent to endanger life. The trial began yesterday at the Oxford Crown Court, where shocking details of the case were revealed.

Julia Knight, a 56-year-old nurse, stood accused of attempting to murder Irene Robson, an 81-year-old patient, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. In a surprising twist, Knight admitted to administering a harmful substance but firmly denied any intention to murder Robson.

The prosecution alleged that Knight had deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, leading to her deteriorating health and subsequent near-death experience. They argued that Knight had harbored a grudge against Robson, although the details surrounding this alleged motive remain unclear.

During the trial's opening statements, the defense acknowledged Knight's administration of the substance but emphasized that there was no intent to kill Robson. Instead, they claimed that Knight had made an error in judgment, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

In a press conference earlier today, Slade explained, ""We have not made any offers to the Heracles forward. I'm not sure why he would make such statements, but it seems like a desperate attempt to generate interest in his services."" 

The player in question has been in impressive form this season, scoring 15 goals in 22 appearances for Heracles. This has led to increased speculation about his future, with several clubs reportedly interested in securing his signature. However, Slade remains adamant that his club is not one of them.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy.

The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change.

The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality.

If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure indicates that the UK's job market has remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit.

The ONS also revealed that the number of people in employment rose by 99,000 during the same period, reaching a record high of 32.7 million. This suggests that businesses are still hiring and expanding despite concerns about the country's future relationship with the European Union.

However, wage growth remains sluggish, with average weekly earnings increasing by only 3.2% excluding bonuses. This is below the rate of inflation, indicating that workers are not seeing much improvement in their purchasing power.

Experts have attributed the low unemployment rate to a combination of factors, including the rise of the gig economy and more people opting for self-employment. However, concerns remain about the quality of jobs being created, as many are part-time or offer low wages.

"Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the fatal crash that claimed the lives of two young children. The incident occurred on the A34 motorway near Newbury, Berkshire, last Saturday.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing Maj Scott's car weaving in and out of traffic before losing control and colliding with another vehicle. The impact caused both cars to veer off the road and crash into a nearby tree.

Tragically, the two children, aged 3 and 5, who were passengers in the other vehicle, were pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of that car, a 32-year-old woman, sustained serious injuries and is currently in critical condition at a local hospital.

"The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said. ""The development of this new global asset class is",human,"Mr Carney stated that long-term financing for green initiatives in emerging markets could enhance financial stability. At a Berlin event, he encouraged Germany to leverage its 2017 G20 presidency to advance this cause. He has previously highlighted climate change risks to the finance sector. On Thursday, he remarked that capital should ideally flow from developed to emerging markets because of higher returns, but in reality, the opposite occurs, lowering bond yields in developed countries. Sporadic capital inflows to emerging economies have caused instability. He emphasized that green finance offers a significant opportunity by directing funds to long-term projects in high-carbon-growth countries, thereby supporting financial stability. Mr Carney noted that green bond issuance, used to fund water or renewable energy projects to cut emissions, might double in 2016 from $42 billion the previous year, though they still constitute only 1% of global financial institutions' holdings.

The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub.

This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory.

Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats.

Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing. The study highlighted concerns over the narrow focus of police officers, potentially leaving other vulnerable individuals at risk.

The research, which remains unpublished, analyzed the practices of three unidentified police forces in England and Wales. It found that officers were dedicating a significant amount of time and resources to cases involving violence, while other risk factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, and domestic disputes were receiving less attention.

Dr. Sarah Cooper, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of a more holistic approach in policing. She argued that by solely focusing on violent cases, officers may be missing opportunities to intervene and prevent harm in other areas of vulnerability.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea.

The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options.

The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods.

The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support.

"The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000. The closure of the facility came as a shock to the local community, which relied heavily on the abattoir for employment and the sourcing of locally produced meat.

Emcol 2008 Ltd had been struggling financially for some time, facing fierce competition from larger meat processing companies and an increasing demand for cheaper imported meat. Despite efforts to streamline operations and cut costs, the company was unable to recover from its mounting debt.

The closure of the abattoir not only resulted in the loss of around 50 jobs, but it also had a significant impact on local farmers who relied on the facility to process their livestock.

"Christopher Kelly, 40, strangled his friend Dorothy Beattie, 51, at her home in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute in May 2020. Kelly, who had known Beattie for several years, initially claimed that she had died by suicide, but evidence presented in court proved otherwise. The motive behind the shocking crime remains unknown.

The trial held at the High Court in Glasgow revealed that Beattie had suffered a violent death at the hands of Kelly.

As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast. The decision by the Parades Commission has sparked controversy and reignited tensions between the Orange Order and the Catholic community.

Critics argue that the restriction is a clear demonstration of religious discrimination, as the parade route has historically included this section of the city. The Orange Order, however, claims that the decision is necessary to avoid potential clashes and maintain order.

The commission's ruling has received mixed reactions from both sides of the divide. Some Protestant groups are supportive, stating that it is a step towards maintaining peace and preventing further violence. On the other hand, Catholic organizations believe that the decision undermines their rights and perpetuates a sectarian divide.

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood types in emergencies. The organization is urging people with O negative blood to come forward and donate, as stocks are running low.

Blood group O negative is considered the universal donor type because it lacks the A and B antigens found in other blood groups. This means it can be given to patients of any blood type in an emergency situation when there isn't enough time to determine their specific blood type.

NHSBT relies on regular blood donations to ensure a steady supply for hospitals across the country. However, recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a decline in blood donations, resulting in a shortage of O negative blood.
