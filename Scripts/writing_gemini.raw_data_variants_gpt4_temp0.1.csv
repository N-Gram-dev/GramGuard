"A man invents time travel in order to find a cure for his sick wife and succeeds, only to find out he can't go back.

"Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. The torrential rain washed away any hope of finding dry shelter. The traveler's heavy, worn cloak offered little protection from the relentless downpour. He stumbled through the dense forest, the only sound the rhythmic patter of rain and the frantic beating of his own heart. Suddenly, a flicker of light caught his eye. A small wooden house, nestled amidst the trees, offered a beacon of hope. He approached cautiously, his hand trembling as he knocked on the door.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.""

If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow.

Though it focuses on female writers, its advice is universal, as this quote shows: > Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included. Coal mining is..."
"You're moments late to literally everything. You watch buses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and meetings commence just as you take your seat.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Build a World Part I: Inception. Let's begin. Imagine a much younger universe, formed less violently, with significantly more mass. The space between planets is filled with breathable air at a pressure that supports life. Solar heat thins this atmosphere to near vacuum close to the sun and heats it into plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward along the plane perpendicular to that, creating a kind of convection current. Due to the sun's magnetic field's variability, this current can be unpredictable and may involve multiple simultaneous currents. This convection-driven heat transfer means that while areas near the sun are extremely hot, the habitable zone is vast. Additionally, solar winds become literal winds, quite noticeable and impactful.","Build a World Part I: Inception.

"It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Poss. A young baker named Penelope, famous for her award-winning sourdough, has taken residence in the soul of Beelzebub, the Lord of Flies, causing him to obsess over yeast starters and sourdough recipes. In the fiery depths of Tartarus, Cerberus, the three-headed dog, has been overtaken by the spirit of a yoga instructor, leading to an endless cycle of howling downward-facing dog poses. And in the palace of Hades, the King of the Underworld himself has been possessed by a retired opera singer, forcing him to belt out mournful arias in the halls of the damned.

"You abduct a child to hold her for ransom, but as you begin to talk to her you realize her home life is actually way more troubling than being kidnapped. I place the bag over her head.

He could remember the way the moonlight would filter through the leaves, casting a dappled pattern on the worn wooden frame. The keys, yellowed with age, seemed to glow in the darkness, beckoning him closer. But as he reached out to touch them, the music would vanish, leaving behind only the rustling of leaves and the chirping of crickets.

From the swirling, violet nebula that birthed it, a life force, a singular entity, rose from the molten core. The entity, known as the Great Weaver, had no form but was felt in the rhythmic pulse of Ashum's heart.

"[ FF ] 5 minute speedwrite: In a war-torn city, a teen who is hiding in the rubble is confronted by a soldier, his face obscured by a grimy mask. 

""Come out,"" the soldier rasped, his voice a low growl against the background of distant explosions. The teen, no more than fifteen, huddled deeper into the hollowed-out space between crumbling bricks. He had been scavenging for food, for anything, when the soldiers arrived. The city, once vibrant and teeming with life, was now a graveyard of shattered dreams and broken bodies. 

""I didn't do anything,"" the teen whispered, his voice trembling. The soldier took a step closer, his boots crunching on broken glass.  ""You know the rules. Anyone outside curfew is a rebel."" He raised his rifle, the glint of the barrel catching the dying light of the setting sun. The teen closed his eyes, bracing for the worst.

"## Day 1 John.

The ground is cold, the air colder. The wind howls a mournful song, a dirge for my freedom. Twenty years.  Twenty years in this desolate expanse, a prison of trees and rock, the only company the screech of an owl and the rustle of unseen things. They say this is for the crime I committed, for the life I took. Yet, it feels like a punishment for the life I’ve been denied. My hands, once deft with a quill, now clench around the rough-hewn axe. I will survive. I must.

The wind still whispers, but now it speaks of home.  My skin is weathered, my hands calloused, yet the memories are sharp, etched deeper than any scar. The axe feels like an extension of my arm, the forest my domain. I have built a life here, a life of quiet solitude, of learning the language of the earth. Yet, even in the stillness, I hear a different song, the song of a life beyond these trees. My exile ends today, and I know I can never truly leave this place. I carry it within me, a part of my soul, a reminder of the price of freedom.

Dear Mariana, 

This may not be your number anymore but I don't care. I just need you to know. I was a fool to let you go. I was scared, I was insecure, I thought you were too good for me. But now, looking back, I realize how much I loved you, how much I still love you. You were the light in my darkest days, the reason I smiled even when everything felt wrong. I miss your laugh, the way you'd tilt your head when you were thinking, the way your eyes would sparkle when you were happy.

My breath hitched. A car accident? My parents, who never drove fast, who always took precautions? The image of their car, mangled and twisted, flashed in my mind, and a wave of nausea washed over me.

"A man forgets to water his potted plant for a whole week. This negligence starts a long chain reaction that leads up to World War III. My plant. It sat there, wilting in the corner, a silent testament to my absent-mindedness.  I should have noticed, but I was distracted.  I was, in fact, busy orchestrating a global conspiracy.  

You see, my plant, a humble philodendron, was no ordinary houseplant. It held a secret, a powerful one. It contained a dormant seed, a seed that held the key to eternal life.  

The CIA, tipped off by an anonymous source, was on my trail.  They had intercepted my coded messages, the ones I sent through the watering can, the ones only a philodendron could understand.

"Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. You probably wouldn't believe it, but it's a reality that has become so ingrained in our society that it's almost normal.  The streets are littered with the bodies of the young, their faces frozen in a mask of terror as they were robbed of their futures.  The old, on the other hand, move about with a new sense of purpose, their eyes gleaming with a chilling intensity.  They know that their time is limited, but they also know that they have the power to steal more time, to cheat death, to live longer.  And they are not afraid to use it.  The world has become a dangerous place, a battleground where the only currency is time.

"## A Man, a Wilderness, and Two Diary Entries

**Day 1**

I. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The sun bleeds through the canopy, casting the forest floor in a tapestry of light and shadow. I stand at the edge of the wilderness, the boundary between civilization and exile.  A cold wind whips through the trees, carrying with it the whispers of my shame.  Twenty years.  Twenty years to atone for my crime, to live amongst the creatures that fear me more than the men I wronged. The wilderness is a harsh mistress, but I must embrace her embrace, for she is my only sanctuary now.

**Day 7300**

I. The sun sets on the horizon, painting the sky with fiery hues of orange and crimson. The air is still, filled with the gentle chirping of crickets. I sit on a moss-covered rock, a weathered journal in my lap. My fingers, gnarled and calloused, trace the words I have written over the years. A lifetime in this wilderness.  My exile is almost over, and the world outside, once familiar, now seems alien.  I have become one with the forest, a creature of the wild.  But will I be welcomed back to the world of men? Or am I destined to forever be a prisoner of my past, even as I am freed from this prison of nature? 
",ai,"A man stands at the edge of the wilderness, where civilization ends and exile begins, surrounded by the scent of pine and damp earth. The sun filters through the trees, casting light and shadow on the forest floor. A cold wind carries whispers of his shame as he reflects on twenty years spent atoning for his crime among creatures that fear him more than humans. The wilderness is unforgiving, yet it is his only refuge now.

Seven thousand three hundred days later, the sun sets in fiery orange and crimson hues. The air is still, filled with cricket songs. Sitting on a mossy rock with a worn journal, his calloused fingers trace years of writing. After a lifetime in the wild, his exile nears its end. The outside world feels strange, and he has become one with the forest. He wonders if he will be accepted back by humanity or remain a prisoner of his past despite his freedom from nature's prison.","The scent of pine needles and moist earth fills the air as a man stands at the boundary between civilization and wilderness.

His name and face flickered up on the screen only after it had started buzzing. I looked over from my computer screen and dully, mild shock registered in my brain. Everything had been dull lately. In my mind, he wasn't dead; he was just calling to tell me some new breakthrough he'd had with whatever he was writing. I picked up my phone and held it for a moment, looking at his smugly smiling face from my screen. I should answer it. But who could be calling me from his number? Why? Why would they do that to me? I answered it. His boyfriend's face popped up. We stared at each other for a minute. He had been crying. I had not been. Finally, he swallowed and said, ""You.... had texted him last. I plugged in his phone. It said -- come home, stay safe. You wanted him to come over to yours."" I sighed. ""He was out really late.

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020. It was a nice neo-Victorian in the middle of the city. A bit overpriced, but the location was perfect.  The previous owners, a family of five, were quiet and kept to themselves.

The elevator was small, just enough for one person. The controls were simple: a single button with a single arrow pointing up. With a hesitant breath, I pressed the button. The elevator lurched into motion. Where it was going, I had no idea.

"## A Creation Myth: The Dance of Light and Shadow

Long ago, before the world was, there lived only a being of pure light. This being, shimmering and radiant, yearned for companionship, for something to share its brilliance with.  But in its solitude, the light grew afraid of its own immensity. It yearned for a counterpoint, a balance. 

One day, the light, in its infinite desire, decided to divide itself. It split into two – one remaining pure and radiant, the other becoming the opposite: cold, dark, and still.  The light, now known as the sun, danced across the void, painting the darkness with its brilliance.  But the darkness, known as the moon, held its own, refusing to be consumed.  And so, the dance began. 

Day after day, the sun chased the moon across the sky, painting the world in vibrant hues and then retreating, allowing the moon to bathe it in its cool, silver light. This eternal chase, this constant interplay of light and dark, became the rhythm of the world, the very essence of life.  And so, the sun and moon, forever intertwined, became the source of the day and night, the creators of the world as we know it.

It was an afterlife, but not the one they had bargained for."
Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done. And I've got to finish the current one which is goal for this month at the very least. We'll see which one I finish editing and decide that I'm comfortable enough with it to try to publish it first. I think maybe I should aim for Goal 2 for the rest of the year. At least a little something. There's a few stories that I'd love to pull into novelette if not novella-length stories. I think world building and outlining are big on my list too this year! I tend to just jump in without doing any sort of world building or outlining of my story.

"[ IP ] Piano of the forest Whether or not the piano was actually real was something that he could not say for certain.

"Two people discover a fountain of youth. The problem is that upon drinking the water, you turn back into an infant. The two decide to take turns raising each other, ensuring a continuous cycle of youth.  

Elias, a weary, aging professor, stumbled upon the fountain while researching ancient myths. He shared his discovery with Amelia, a young woman who had always felt trapped by her fleeting youth. They agreed on a plan: Elias would drink first, becoming an infant, while Amelia cared for him. When he reached adulthood, he would tend to Amelia while she experienced her second childhood. 

Their lives became a perpetual loop of infancy and maturity, punctuated by the joyous chaos of diaper changes and the bittersweet melancholy of forgotten memories.

"An angel has now been exiled from both Heaven and Hell. Apparently causing one little tiny apocalypse is enough to get one fired in that town, and not.  They’d have had more sympathy if she’d managed to level a city, apparently. Not that she was sorry. In fact, she felt quite pleased with herself.  After all, she’d merely rearranged a couple of planetary alignments, creating a minor solar flare that had fried a few communication satellites. It wasn't her fault if the resulting power outage had caused the entire global economy to grind to a halt. She was merely fulfilling her destiny, as a bringer of chaos.  

Now, she was stranded on Earth, a planet of mud and grass and creatures that ate each other.  It was a far cry from the celestial landscapes she was accustomed to, but she supposed it had a certain charm.  There were, for instance, a great many humans. And they were all so completely oblivious to their own absurdity. That’s what she enjoyed most about them.  Their ignorance was a kind of bliss.  She figured she could stay here a while.  Maybe even try her hand at a little human mischief.  A tiny, little apocalypse, perhaps.

"It's the year 2064. Describe yourself engaged in your favorite everyday activity. I watch my tiny daughter's face as she gurgles and drools with thoughtless enthusiasm.

Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life.

"An advanced alien race intercepts the Voyager 1 and discover the golden record. They have no idea what it is or how to use it.  

The shimmering disc, inscribed with strange symbols, lay on a metallic table in the center of the ship's observation deck.  The three Xylar, their bodies composed of shifting light, stared at it with curiosity.  Zyrk, the youngest, reached out a tentacle and gently touched the surface.  The disc vibrated faintly, a low hum that resonated through the chamber.  

""What is it?"" asked Xyl, the elder, his voice a series of clicks and whistles. 

""It seems to be some kind of communication device,"" replied Zyl, his tentacle retracting.  ""But we can't decipher the symbols.""

The Xylar, a race known for their scientific prowess, had never encountered anything like it. The golden record, a relic of a vanished civilization, held within it the story of humanity.  But for now, it remained a mystery, waiting to be unlocked.

""So, what do you think?"" Sam stammered, handing him a coffee. ""It's... different,"" Quentin admitted, taking a sip. ""No blood, no guns, just a sweet, bittersweet story about two old friends reuniting after decades."" Sam blinked, incredulous. ""But... no shootouts? No 'F-bombs'?"" Quentin chuckled.

In a large cardboard box, the kind that sagged along the bottom with crinkled corners, thick tape all around and sharpie on the sides were all her earthly possessions. Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt conflicted, a mix of sadness, anger and pain welled deep within her. She had more questions than answers and no one left to talk to.

“Well, well,” she said, her voice a silky whisper that held a dangerous edge. “Look what the tide has washed in. I was wondering when you lot would show up.”

"## A Man in the Wilderness

**Day 1:**

The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and fear. I'm alone, banished to this forsaken wilderness, my life stripped bare, my future an empty canvas. The forest whispers secrets I don't understand, and the shadows seem to hold judgment. I built a meager shelter, a flimsy shield against the unknown. A single tear rolls down my cheek, leaving a salty trace on my skin. Twenty years. I can barely fathom the immensity of that time.

**Day 7,300:**

The sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and fading purple. This final sunset is different. I don't feel fear, only a quiet acceptance. The wilderness has been my teacher, my tormentor, my solace. I have learned to survive, to endure, to find beauty in the stark simplicity of life.  The forest, once a prison, now feels like home. It's time to return. I am not the same man who walked in all those years ago. I am stronger, wiser, more at peace.  And I carry the wilderness with me, forever etched into the landscape of my soul.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end."" 

It's a deceptively simple concept, yet the beginning can be the most daunting part of writing a story. Fear not, fellow storytellers! The secret lies in your imagination. Let a single image, a whispered phrase, or a fleeting thought ignite your creative spark. It could be a flickering candle in a dusty attic, the scent of cinnamon on a chilly night, or the rustle of leaves in a silent forest.

Once you have your seed, let it grow. Explore the world it suggests, delve into the emotions it evokes, and let the characters unfold before you. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. So, begin at the beginning, let your pen dance, and let the magic of storytelling weave its spell.

## The Hound of the Baskervilles, Retired

The once-sharp scent of blood had dulled to a faint, dusty whiff. Sherlock Holmes, his keen mind now a haze of forgotten deductions, sat hunched in a dusty armchair, clutching a lukewarm cup of tea. The London fog, once his ally in concealing his movements, now clung to him like a shroud.  

His flat, once a haven of intellectual pursuits, was now a cluttered haven of despair. The violin lay silent, its strings forever tuned to the melody of forgotten triumphs. The magnifying glass, a symbol of his brilliance, lay shattered on the floor, reflecting only the dim glow of a single candle. 

The world had moved on, leaving Holmes behind in the twilight of his career.  He was a shadow of his former self, a legend whispered about in hushed tones, a ghost haunting the forgotten corners of his own mind.

"This morning, as you vacantly stirred your coffee, you unwittingly hypnotised yourself. The song playing on the radio trickled into your mind and took. It wasn't the melody, nor the lyrics, but the hypnotic rhythm that pulsed, a steady thrum against the backdrop of your mundane routine. With each sip, you felt a growing sense of detachment, as if your consciousness was slipping away.  You stared at the steam rising from your mug, watching it dance in the morning light.

"You discover that Earth is the ""North Korea"" of the galaxy. It happened by fluke when a Czarnian turned up looking to make a documentary on the ""most isolated, secretive, and technologically backward planet in the known universe."" This Czarnian, a flamboyant fellow named Zorp, was expecting something like a swamp planet, a place where sentient cacti worshipped a giant space rock. What he got was a bustling, technologically advanced planet with a global network and a thriving social media scene.  

""You have… internet?"" Zorp asked, his three eyes wide with disbelief as you explained the concept of the internet, social media, and the various streaming services available. You explained that Earth was a democracy, with free speech and a vibrant political scene. He laughed, a raucous, throaty sound, ""Democracy? What is this, a joke?"" 

It turned out Earth, despite its advanced technology and global interconnectedness, was considered a pariah in the galactic community. The reason? Our tendency to hoard information and technology, our fear of contact with the ""unknown,"" and our general paranoia about extraterrestrial life. Zorp's film crew left with their tails between their legs, muttering about the ""unfathomable absurdity"" of the human race.

"## Build a World Part I: Inception

Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no stars, only vast, swirling nebulae? Imagine a universe where the very fabric of space is alive, pulsing with a gentle, luminescent energy. This energy coalesces into swirling clouds of gas and dust, each one unique and constantly changing. Instead of planets, there are vast, organic islands of land, floating on currents of the nebulae. Life, in this universe, takes the form of bioluminescent creatures, their bodies shimmering and pulsing like the nebulae themselves. They are interconnected, their minds forming a vast, shared consciousness, communicating through the subtle shifting patterns of their light. 

Perhaps the first sentient beings in this universe wouldn't be individual creatures, but rather these interconnected clouds, whispering their secrets through the swirling patterns of light.

I watch the same news channel before I took my constantly consistent stroll into the sunrise. After all I am the model that I want all others to follow.

"## Day 1.

The world shrieks behind me, a cacophony of shouts and laughter, now fading to a distant hum. I turn, and the thick pines swallow my last glimpse of civilization. The forest is a green leviathan, its secrets whispered in the rustle of leaves. I am alone, banished to this wilderness for twenty years, my crime a whispered word, my punishment a silent sentence. My skin prickles, a mix of fear and an unknown thrill. I carry only a small knife, a leather pouch of seeds, and the weight of my guilt. I will learn to survive, or I will succumb to the wilderness. 

## Day 7,300.

The air, once sharp and new, is now a familiar comfort. The forest, once a menacing giant, is now a friend, its whispers lullabies. My skin, tanned and weathered, bears the scars of a thousand tiny battles, each a testament to my survival. The world beyond the trees is a distant memory, a faded echo of a life I once knew. The guilt, once a searing ember, has cooled into a quiet ache. I have found peace in the wild, a peace that transcends the judgment of men. The sun sets, painting the sky in hues of crimson and gold. I sit by the fire, its warmth embracing me, a silent farewell to the life I left behind. The forest is my home now, and I am its son. I am ready to return, not to the world that banished me, but to the peace I found within.

"The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. Just as she expected, the one on the right was cold. But the third nob.... Grace didn't know what that might be. She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements when she tried on big-girl clothes. So the mystery of the third faucet tap would also be a great surprise when she tried it. Giovanni's hand barely caught Grace's in time. ""No, my flower!"" He was frightened. She could tell.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was grieving, her face remained resolutely blank.

I was in the glass box overlooking the enormous experimentation chamber. In the very center lies the Disc, the harsh light glaring off of its shiny surface.

Our greatest academics had decided that mathematics would be the only way to efficiently communicate with other alien civilizations, seeing that our complex language was far too hard for others to understand without assistance. The first few scans cleared up the physical properties of the item - hundreds of rings, with even more grooves in each ring. At first we thought that we were supposed to run an item, a sort of *bit*, through the rings, but when we discovered the full physical appearence it seemed nonsensical.

"A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Henderson for as long as I can remember.

The Prince is dead. Somewhen in the climbing of the stairs or during one of those high-jumps he is so famous for. It doesn't matter. He's gone, and the city is in mourning. Or, at least, it should be. But the whispers in the shadows speak of something else - a rebellion brewing, a thirst for freedom long suppressed.

Yet, amidst the chaos, a young woman named Elara, a street urchin who witnessed the Prince's final moments, sees a chance for change. She holds a secret, a whispered truth about the Prince's death, a truth that could shatter the fragile peace and ignite a revolution. Will she speak?

"It's the year 2064. I watch my tiny daughter's face as she navigates the holographic cityscape projected onto her wrist-mounted console. Her brow furrows in concentration, tiny fingers tracing the shimmering buildings and swirling traffic.

I yearn for her to experience the real world, to feel the wind on her face and the sun on her skin, but for now, this virtual playground is all she knows.  But the world is changing rapidly.

"To my unborn child,

Your mother is carrying you now, four months along, a beautiful secret blossoming within her. I won't be here to hold you, to watch you take your first steps, to teach you the alphabet. The doctors say I have less than two months. 

I know it's unfair, that you'll never know the warmth of my embrace, the sound of my laughter. But know this, my love: your mother will be your everything. She'll be the sun that warms your soul, the moon that guides your dreams. She'll tell you stories of your father, a man who loved you fiercely, even before he knew you. 

Live your life with courage, with kindness, with the same unyielding spirit your mother carries. You are a miracle, my child, a testament to the enduring power of love. I will be with you always, in every heartbeat, in every sunrise, in every gentle breeze.

Love always,
Your Dad.

"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately it's the worst person they could have chosen... I remembered her, of course. The three of us had followed her into the alley, smiling at the idiocy of some girl to be walking in this area, at this time, all alone, *and then to willingly walk down an alleyway. * She turned up her nose at us when we told her to give us her money. ""Why would I give you my money?"" She'd said, lip curling as she looked us over. We thought she was just rich and petty. Idiots. I gave her a cut, right on her pretty cheekbone. Not a bad one, but it would scar. And she would remember us, remember fear, remember her place. Maybe then she wouldn't leave the safety of society, stick with her parents. God I regret that.

"[IP] Hidden Harbour by Max Hugo

This had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At least. The storm had been a brutal one. The kind that tears the fabric of reality, leaving only tattered shreds of normalcy behind. The world had gone mad, a whirlwind of chaos and fear. But here, nestled amidst the salt-kissed cliffs and whispering pines of Hidden Harbour, there was a semblance of peace. 

I had found solace in the simple things – the gentle rocking of the boat at anchor, the smell of salt air, the rhythmic crashing of waves against the shore.  Here, amidst the natural symphony of the ocean, I could finally breathe. I could finally be myself. The storm had washed away the past, leaving only a clean slate, and in this sanctuary, I could rebuild, piece by piece, the life I had lost.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore.

"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it charged, maintained and in good working order. There are a lot of benefits to this, but there are also a lot of drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits is that you would have more free time to do whatever you want. You could spend time with your family, travel, or pursue your hobbies. You would also have more money to spend, as you wouldn't be spending it on things like transportation and food.

However, there are also some drawbacks to this system. One is that it could lead to widespread unemployment. If everyone had a robot that did their work for them, there would be no need for human workers. This could have a devastating impact on the economy.

Another drawback is that it could lead to a decrease in human creativity and innovation. If people are no longer working, they may not be as motivated to come up with new ideas. This could have a negative impact on society as a whole.

He spoke calmly, outlining the new world order, a world where those who had tasted the darkness must now find a way to live in the light.

On the second night, He followed our plates, always full, wasteful; until he found The Cherub, a child, hateful; fat, engorged; spewing vile bile down our throats. Our Hero set him alight.

"""Well.... Shit."" Well.... Shit. The rain hammered the ground. Sheets of water poured themselves over the landscape. It was difficult to see through the vale, but I could see it. A massive fireball erupted just a couple of miles away. Moments later I felt it. The smashing, thudding, sensation of a shock wave, followed instantly by a loud boom. I stumbled backwards as the pressure ripped through my body, taking me by surprise. This definitely wasn't a movie, the sound and flash perfectly in sync. This was real. I sat down on a large rock.'Well.... shit,' I mumbled. The fireball was gone now, but the fire blazed strong, fighting the natural elements that were it's enemy. It licked skyward. I couldn't see the smoke in the rain, but I could see the flames. Water splashed in my eyes, and was streaming down my face, and yet it didn't seem to have any impact on the inferno.

"[ CW ] Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. When we were together, we always took walks. They were long and meandering, more adventuresome than your simple afternoon stroll. We would walk, hand in hand, and observe things about our environment. It was what we loved to do. Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants. Big, small, leafy, sprightly, nothing really fascinated me so much as watching something grow, watching it slowly make progress, fighting against the sky. I was drawn to the ground, I suppose. One of my own quirks. She drew me up. She loved the sunset, the kiss of the wind. She saw what I couldn't in them. She raised my gaze, changed my perspective. Our second-to-last walk was last October. Shortly after that, she was diagnosed. She had been feeling poorly, coughing often, but we could never have expected it. Lung cancer. We couldn't understand, no matter how hard we tried.

She, however, lifted me up, loving sunsets and the gentle wind's touch. She showed me beauty I couldn't see, changing how I viewed the world. Our second-to-last walk was last October. Soon after, she was diagnosed. She had been coughing and feeling unwell, but lung cancer was a shock. We struggled to understand because lung cancer was a smoker's disease, and she... but in the end, her spirit shone brighter than any diagnosis.","Together, we always took long, meandering walks that were more adventurous than a simple afternoon stroll.

"Our blind date cosplays as a spot-on Overwatch character. So good that you suspect they may actually be that character. Mike stood on the side, nervously adjusting his glasses. He’d been excited for this date, but he wasn't sure if he was ready for this. Across the crowded cafe, his date was a vision. They were dressed as D.Va, the Korean gamer, complete with a pink mech suit, pigtails, and even the iconic gamer headset.  Their eyes, however, were the most striking. They held a mischievous spark that was eerily similar to the animated D.Va.

Mike felt his heart beat faster. Was this a real person or a particularly talented cosplayer? Maybe it was a secret Overwatch agent?  He couldn't help but feel a touch of intrigue mixed with his nervousness. As he walked towards his date, he tried to play it cool.  He had a feeling this wouldn't be an ordinary date.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series.

For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument.

"Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her face buried in a worn teddy bear.  His fur was matted and faded, but his button eyes still held the same comforting gaze as the day she got him. Her throat tightened with the familiar lump of fear.

"The Three Laws

The interview had continued for several hours. Andy could barely stand on his own two feet, a combination of fatigue and anxiety, when Terra, the head of the robotics division, finally dismissed him. ""We'll let you know our decision,"" she had said, her voice unreadable. As Andy walked back to his car, he couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of dread. He'd poured his heart and soul into designing his latest creation, a humanoid robot unlike anything the world had seen before. But the company's strict adherence to the Three Laws of Robotics had cast a long shadow over his work. The laws were designed to ensure robots remained subservient to humans, but Andy knew they also stifled innovation. He couldn't help but wonder if his creation, with its revolutionary AI, would be deemed too dangerous, too unpredictable, to be allowed to exist.

"A team of Extra Terrestrial scientists reach Earth, which they deemed ""potentially habitable"" from their planet, and are astonished by their findings.

"You're playing Scrabble with the devil for your soul. ""SON OF A BITCH"" he screamed, obviously contemplating flipping the board. ""Sat. An.  I.  C."" he spat, flinging the tiles down with a venomous snap. ""It's a real word, you insufferable mortal!""

You were no longer yourself, but a middle-aged, bumbling paper salesman with a penchant for inappropriate jokes and an even stronger love for ""that's what she said."" Your own body felt strangely distant, a memory from a life you could no longer access. 

You needed a plan, and fast.  How could you possibly convince your co-workers that you weren't Michael Scott? The first step, you decided, was to act as un-Michael as possible. You would need to suppress the urge to make a ""that's what she said"" joke, or to launch into a bizarre anecdote about your childhood. You would be the calm, collected, and most importantly, *professional* version of Michael Scott.

"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to have a complete understanding of the truth. You have to know what you're hiding from, what you're running from.Within every lie, there is some dark spot, some blurred edge. The truth is always there; you just have to find it. So maybe I'm lying. Or maybe I'm telling the truth, because I know you won't believe me. Maybe it's both- just enough truth to convince you, just enough lie to hide behind. I'm not asking you to believe me. After everything, I know better than to ask you to trust me. But the real question here is: why? Another characteristic of liars: we're smart.

"[TT] Heron of Alexandria realizes that his Aeolipile can be used as a steam engine. The industrial revolution begins in the 1st century AD.  

The world watched in awe as the first steam-powered contraptions whirred and clattered, driven by the power of boiling water.  Heron's simple toy, a spinning sphere driven by escaping steam, had sparked a revolution.  Mills were soon powered by steam, and soon, ships began to navigate the seas, no longer dependent on wind.

Now even fools can see that our path was the path of prosperity. And the waters ran red. Religion had all but died out among humans. Only a handful of defiant elders remained.
