"Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. The torrential rain washed away any hope of finding dry shelter. The traveler's heavy, worn cloak offered little protection from the relentless downpour. He stumbled through the dense forest, the only sound the rhythmic patter of rain and the frantic beating of his own heart. Suddenly, a flicker of light caught his eye. A small wooden house, nestled amidst the trees, offered a beacon of hope. He approached cautiously, his hand trembling as he knocked on the door. A moment of silence stretched into an eternity before a gruff voice boomed, ""Who's there?""  The traveler hesitated, his voice barely a whisper, ""Rain."" ""Rain who?""  The voice echoed again, anticipation building. ""Rain or shine, I need shelter!"" he cried, his desperation spilling over. The door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow.  ""Come in,"" the voice said, a hint of warmth replacing the previous gruffness. The traveler stepped inside, leaving the relentless rain behind.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). The question specifically deals with writing as a female (which may or may not apply to you) but the answer is universal, as evidenced by this particular quote: > Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included. Coal mining is",human,"How should I begin? To quote the late Lewis Carroll, ""Start at the beginning and proceed until you reach the end; then stop."" Writing feels less daunting once you understand the big secret: becoming a good writer involves getting all your bad writing out of the way. Don't overthink, just write. Don't stress if your writing is poor. That's actually a good sign. If it's bad, it means you're clearing out the bad stuff to make room for the good. Not everyone will be a great writer, but no one becomes one without first producing some bad work.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Let's begin with a younger, less violently formed universe containing significantly more mass. The spaces between worlds are filled with breathable air at a pressure suitable for survival. Sunlight thins this air to near-vacuum near the sun's surface and heats it into plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases are pushed away along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases along a plane perpendicular to that, creating a convection current. Due to the sun's varying magnetic field, this current is unpredictable and may involve multiple currents simultaneously. This convection causes significant heat transfer, making areas near the sun extremely hot, but expanding the habitable zone greatly. Solar winds in this scenario are essentially actual winds, quite substantial.","Imagine a much younger universe with less violent origins and far more mass. The void between planets is filled with breathable air at a safe pressure. Near the sun, sunlight thins the air to almost a vacuum and heats it into plasma at close range. Hot charged gases are pushed away along the sun's magnetic poles, which pulls cooler gases in along a plane at right angles to those poles, forming a convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field changes unpredictably, this current may be complex and multi-layered. The heat transfer from this convection makes the sun's vicinity extremely hot, but vastly enlarges the habitable zone. Solar winds in this universe behave like real winds, quite strong and noticeable.","Let's start with a younger, less violently formed cosmos that contains much more mass. The space between worlds is filled with air that's breathable at a pressure that supports life. The sun's heat thins this air to near vacuum near its surface, heating it to plasma at close distances. Hot, charged gases are pushed away along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases in along a plane perpendicular to those poles, creating a convection current. Given the sun's changing magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and multifaceted. The resulting heat transfer makes zones close to the sun extremely hot but greatly expands the habitable zone. Solar winds here are literally winds, substantial and noteworthy.","Consider a universe that's younger and less violently created, with significantly more mass. The empty space between worlds contains breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this air to near vacuum near its surface and converts it into plasma nearby. Hot charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane at 90 degrees, forming a convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, this current can be unstable and may consist of multiple currents simultaneously. This convection causes heat transfer that makes areas near the sun unbearably hot but expands the habitable zone greatly. Solar winds in this setting are genuine winds, strong and real.","Let's envision a much younger, less violently originated universe with vastly more mass. The void between planets is filled with breathable air at a pressure that allows survival. The sun's heat reduces this air to near vacuum near its surface and heats it into plasma close by.

"It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Poss. A young baker named Penelope, famous for her award-winning sourdough, has taken residence in the soul of Beelzebub, the Lord of Flies, causing him to obsess over yeast starters and sourdough recipes. In the fiery depths of Tartarus, Cerberus, the three-headed dog, has been overtaken by the spirit of a yoga instructor, leading to an endless cycle of howling downward-facing dog poses. And in the palace of Hades, the King of the Underworld himself has been possessed by a retired opera singer, forcing him to belt out mournful arias in the halls of the damned. This new wave of Humanic Poss, a divine twist of fate, has turned the tables on the supernatural world, leaving demons bewildered and powerless against the overwhelming human spirit.

"You are a teenager with the ability to measure how ""Dangerous"" people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them.  It's a strange gift, one you haven't quite figured out how to handle.  Your best friend, Max, is a solid 2, while the grumpy cashier at the grocery store is a 7.  You avoid the creepy guy in the park, a solid 9, and steer clear of the chatty old lady on the bus, surprisingly a 6. You can't tell why, but the numbers feel right.

You've never encountered a 10 before, and you know you need to be careful.  The danger is real, but so is the urge to unravel the mystery behind this enigmatic stranger.

He raised his rifle, the glint of the barrel catching the dying light of the setting sun. The teen closed his eyes, bracing for the worst.

"## Day 1 John.

The ground is cold, the air colder. The wind howls a mournful song, a dirge for my freedom. Twenty years.  Twenty years in this desolate expanse, a prison of trees and rock, the only company the screech of an owl and the rustle of unseen things. They say this is for the crime I committed, for the life I took. Yet, it feels like a punishment for the life I’ve been denied. My hands, once deft with a quill, now clench around the rough-hewn axe. I will survive. I must.

## Day 7300  John.

The wind still whispers, but now it speaks of home.  My skin is weathered, my hands calloused, yet the memories are sharp, etched deeper than any scar. The axe feels like an extension of my arm, the forest my domain. I have built a life here, a life of quiet solitude, of learning the language of the earth. Yet, even in the stillness, I hear a different song, the song of a life beyond these trees. My exile ends today, and I know I can never truly leave this place. I carry it within me, a part of my soul, a reminder of the price of freedom.

"Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. You probably wouldn't believe it, but it's a reality that has become so ingrained in our society that it's almost normal.  The streets are littered with the bodies of the young, their faces frozen in a mask of terror as they were robbed of their futures.  The old, on the other hand, move about with a new sense of purpose, their eyes gleaming with a chilling intensity.  They know that their time is limited, but they also know that they have the power to steal more time, to cheat death, to live longer.  And they are not afraid to use it.  The world has become a dangerous place, a battleground where the only currency is time.

"Having read online that the Bermuda Triangle is apparently bogus, you decide to test it out for yourself. My heart was bold and brazen My eyes were filled with wonder. Though my cheeks were all unshaven My mind was set to plunder. Within my sights, that treasured goal Of riches, fame, and glory. And yet, alas, not one single soul Would live to tell the story. I felt not fear, not now, not yet, As we sailed through forbidden waters. Though I'd soon begin to flit and fret As the air around grew hotter. The sun burned without respite And my arms turned crimson red. Time slowly creeped by until that night As I carefully crept into bed. My dreams that night were vivid As sweat soaked through my sheet. A girl appeared, quite livid And one refrain she did repeat: “ There's reason for those who stay away From these waters in which you reside. If you do not turn back within a day Then you shall surely die ” I woke from this dream in a panic, Not sure of my place or the time. My mind was filled with thoughts",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"## A Man, a Wilderness, and Two Diary Entries

**Day 1**

I. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The sun bleeds through the canopy, casting the forest floor in a tapestry of light and shadow. I stand at the edge of the wilderness, the boundary between civilization and exile.  A cold wind whips through the trees, carrying with it the whispers of my shame.  Twenty years.  Twenty years to atone for my crime, to live amongst the creatures that fear me more than the men I wronged. The wilderness is a harsh mistress, but I must embrace her embrace, for she is my only sanctuary now.

**Day 7300**

I. The sun sets on the horizon, painting the sky with fiery hues of orange and crimson. The air is still, filled with the gentle chirping of crickets. I sit on a moss-covered rock, a weathered journal in my lap. My fingers, gnarled and calloused, trace the words I have written over the years. A lifetime in this wilderness.  My exile is almost over, and the world outside, once familiar, now seems alien.  I have become one with the forest, a creature of the wild.  But will I be welcomed back to the world of men? Or am I destined to forever be a prisoner of my past, even as I am freed from this prison of nature?

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020. It was a nice neo-Victorian in the middle of the city. A bit overpriced, but the location was perfect.  The previous owners, a family of five, were quiet and kept to themselves.  They didn't seem the type to build secret passageways, but there it was - a smooth, steel door behind a false bookcase in the basement. The only way I discovered it was when I tried to move some boxes and the bookcase shifted, revealing the door. Curiosity got the better of me. I pulled the door open. 

The elevator was small, just enough for one person. The controls were simple: a single button with a single arrow pointing up. With a hesitant breath, I pressed the button. The elevator lurched into motion. Where it was going, I had no idea.

"This isn't home, but it'll do. The hot midday sun glared down on me from up above, a condemning sneer as I leaned back against the elm. I sat, feet no longer able to keep me up and fighting. My shirt was stiff with sweat, dirty and blood, and it protested as I tried to pull it free from my jeans. My shoulder was stiff where I had fallen from my horse, and I could feel cracked ribs grating together as I tried to tease some movement into it. Out of all my aches though, thirst plagued me most, the dust bowl of my throat crying out for help. All I could think about was the small muddy creek I had been too proud to lap at yesterday.

"## A Creation Myth: The Dance of Light and Shadow

Long ago, before the world was, there lived only a being of pure light. This being, shimmering and radiant, yearned for companionship, for something to share its brilliance with.  But in its solitude, the light grew afraid of its own immensity. It yearned for a counterpoint, a balance. 

One day, the light, in its infinite desire, decided to divide itself. It split into two – one remaining pure and radiant, the other becoming the opposite: cold, dark, and still.  The light, now known as the sun, danced across the void, painting the darkness with its brilliance.  But the darkness, known as the moon, held its own, refusing to be consumed.  And so, the dance began. 

Day after day, the sun chased the moon across the sky, painting the world in vibrant hues and then retreating, allowing the moon to bathe it in its cool, silver light. This eternal chase, this constant interplay of light and dark, became the rhythm of the world, the very essence of life.  And so, the sun and moon, forever intertwined, became the source of the day and night, the creators of the world as we know it.

Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done.

"An angel has now been exiled from both Heaven and Hell. Apparently causing one little tiny apocalypse is enough to get one fired in that town, and not.

"An advanced alien race intercepts the Voyager 1 and discover the golden record. They have no idea what it is or how to use it.  

The shimmering disc, inscribed with strange symbols, lay on a metallic table in the center of the ship's observation deck.  The three Xylar, their bodies composed of shifting light, stared at it with curiosity.  Zyrk, the youngest, reached out a tentacle and gently touched the surface.  The disc vibrated faintly, a low hum that resonated through the chamber.  

""What is it?"" asked Xyl, the elder, his voice a series of clicks and whistles. 

""It seems to be some kind of communication device,"" replied Zyl, his tentacle retracting.  ""But we can't decipher the symbols.""

"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately, it's the worst person they could have chosen…

I remembered her, of course. The way her eyes, usually bright and lively, had hardened into something cold and calculating. The faint scent of ozone that clung to her like a second skin. The way she moved, with a fluid grace that belied the raw power she held within. 

She turned, her gaze sweeping over the four of them, and a low chuckle escaped her lips. It wasn't a friendly sound, more like a wind whipping through a graveyard. 

“Well, well,” she said, her voice a silky whisper that held a dangerous edge. “Look what the tide has washed in. I was wondering when you lot would show up.” 

The leader, a hulking man with a face that looked like it had been carved from granite, swallowed nervously. “We just wanted your wallet, lady.”

“You just wanted my wallet,” she repeated, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “And what makes you think I'd give it to you?” 

The alleyway suddenly felt very small, very cold, very dangerous. 
",ai,"A gang of muggers trails someone into a narrow alley. Unfortunately for them, they've picked the absolute worst target...

I recognized her immediately. Her eyes, once full of life and warmth, had turned sharp and calculating. She carried a faint scent of ozone, almost like a second skin. Her movements were fluid and graceful, masking the immense strength she possessed.

She pivoted, scanning the four men with a cold gaze, and let out a low, eerie chuckle. It wasn’t friendly—more like the wind howling through a graveyard.

“Well, well,” she murmured, her voice smooth but edged with menace. “Look who the tide has brought in. I was wondering when you would show up.”

The leader, a massive man with a face like chiseled stone, swallowed hard. “We just wanted your wallet, ma’am.”

“You just wanted my wallet?” she repeated, sarcasm dripping from her tone. “And why would you think I’d hand it over?”

The alley suddenly felt cramped, cold, and dangerously tense.","A group of attackers follow a lone individual into an alley, only to find themselves facing the worst possible opponent...

I remembered her clearly. Her eyes, once bright and lively, had become cold and calculating. There was a faint smell of ozone around her, like a second skin. She moved with a smooth grace that concealed the immense power she harbored.

She turned, her eyes scanning the four men, and a low, unsettling chuckle escaped her. It was more like a chilling wind over a graveyard than a friendly laugh.

“Well, well,” she said softly, her voice silky but edged with danger. “Look who’s come crawling in. I was waiting for you.”

"## A Man in the Wilderness

**Day 1:**

The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and fear. I'm alone, banished to this forsaken wilderness, my life stripped bare, my future an empty canvas. The forest whispers secrets I don't understand, and the shadows seem to hold judgment. I built a meager shelter, a flimsy shield against the unknown. A single tear rolls down my cheek, leaving a salty trace on my skin. Twenty years. I can barely fathom the immensity of that time.

**Day 7,300:**

The sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and fading purple. This final sunset is different. I don't feel fear, only a quiet acceptance. The wilderness has been my teacher, my tormentor, my solace. I have learned to survive, to endure, to find beauty in the stark simplicity of life.  The forest, once a prison, now feels like home. It's time to return. I am not the same man who walked in all those years ago. I am stronger, wiser, more at peace.  And I carry the wilderness with me, forever etched into the landscape of my soul.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end."" 

It's a deceptively simple concept, yet the beginning can be the most daunting part of writing a story. Fear not, fellow storytellers! The secret lies in your imagination. Let a single image, a whispered phrase, or a fleeting thought ignite your creative spark. It could be a flickering candle in a dusty attic, the scent of cinnamon on a chilly night, or the rustle of leaves in a silent forest.

Once you have your seed, let it grow. Explore the world it suggests, delve into the emotions it evokes, and let the characters unfold before you. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. So, begin at the beginning, let your pen dance, and let the magic of storytelling weave its spell.

## The Hound of the Baskervilles, Retired

The once-sharp scent of blood had dulled to a faint, dusty whiff. Sherlock Holmes, his keen mind now a haze of forgotten deductions, sat hunched in a dusty armchair, clutching a lukewarm cup of tea. The London fog, once his ally in concealing his movements, now clung to him like a shroud.  

His flat, once a haven of intellectual pursuits, was now a cluttered haven of despair. The violin lay silent, its strings forever tuned to the melody of forgotten triumphs. The magnifying glass, a symbol of his brilliance, lay shattered on the floor, reflecting only the dim glow of a single candle. 

The world had moved on, leaving Holmes behind in the twilight of his career.  He was a shadow of his former self, a legend whispered about in hushed tones, a ghost haunting the forgotten corners of his own mind.

"You discover that Earth is the ""North Korea"" of the galaxy. It happened by fluke when a Czarnian turned up looking to make a documentary on the ""most isolated, secretive, and technologically backward planet in the known universe."" This Czarnian, a flamboyant fellow named Zorp, was expecting something like a swamp planet, a place where sentient cacti worshipped a giant space rock. What he got was a bustling, technologically advanced planet with a global network and a thriving social media scene.  

""You have… internet?"" Zorp asked, his three eyes wide with disbelief as you explained the concept of the internet, social media, and the various streaming services available. You explained that Earth was a democracy, with free speech and a vibrant political scene. He laughed, a raucous, throaty sound, ""Democracy? What is this, a joke?"" 

It turned out Earth, despite its advanced technology and global interconnectedness, was considered a pariah in the galactic community. The reason? Our tendency to hoard information and technology, our fear of contact with the ""unknown,"" and our general paranoia about extraterrestrial life. Zorp's film crew left with their tails between their legs, muttering about the ""unfathomable absurdity"" of the human race.

"## Build a World Part I: Inception

Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no stars, only vast, swirling nebulae? Imagine a universe where the very fabric of space is alive, pulsing with a gentle, luminescent energy. This energy coalesces into swirling clouds of gas and dust, each one unique and constantly changing. Instead of planets, there are vast, organic islands of land, floating on currents of the nebulae. Life, in this universe, takes the form of bioluminescent creatures, their bodies shimmering and pulsing like the nebulae themselves. They are interconnected, their minds forming a vast, shared consciousness, communicating through the subtle shifting patterns of their light. 

Perhaps the first sentient beings in this universe wouldn't be individual creatures, but rather these interconnected clouds, whispering their secrets through the swirling patterns of light.

"## Day 1.

The world shrieks behind me, a cacophony of shouts and laughter, now fading to a distant hum. I turn, and the thick pines swallow my last glimpse of civilization. The forest is a green leviathan, its secrets whispered in the rustle of leaves. I am alone, banished to this wilderness for twenty years, my crime a whispered word, my punishment a silent sentence. My skin prickles, a mix of fear and an unknown thrill. I carry only a small knife, a leather pouch of seeds, and the weight of my guilt. I will learn to survive, or I will succumb to the wilderness.

My skin, tanned and weathered, bears the scars of a thousand tiny battles, each a testament to my survival. The world beyond the trees is a distant memory, a faded echo of a life I once knew. The guilt, once a searing ember, has cooled into a quiet ache. I have found peace in the wild, a peace that transcends the judgment of men. The sun sets, painting the sky in hues of crimson and gold. I sit by the fire, its warmth embracing me, a silent farewell to the life I left behind. The forest is my home now, and I am its son.

The thing about doomsday devices is that they have near limitless energy. To mess with one without knowing the proper precautions and safety restrictions was practically asking to doomsday.... -*ing* the whole planet.

I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies. This is the last thing I've found in it, along with a dull pocket knife, a canteen water bottle, a pen and some thin string, which I've been using for snares.

"You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years you've become jaded and bored, watching the world spin and change.  You've seen empires rise and fall, plagues and wars, the invention of the wheel, the splitting of the atom. Each new discovery, every triumph, felt hollow.  You've lived through the joy of love and the pain of loss, each experience as fleeting as a summer breeze.  Now you exist in a state of perpetual weariness, watching from a distance, detached and cynical.  You wonder if there's anything left to experience, anything that could break through the impenetrable barrier of your ennui.  Then, one day, you see something that stirs a flicker of interest within your soul. A child, eyes wide with wonder, gazing at the sunrise.  A simple act, yet it speaks of hope, a reminder that even amidst the constant cycle of life and death, there is still beauty to be found.  Perhaps, just perhaps, there's still something left for you to discover.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ""The Waste Land"" by T.S. Eliot, but with a softer touch.

"Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Dear Mariana, this may not be your number anymore but I don't care I had to get this out. When you and I started are little ""relationship"" I guess you could call it that, it was really pretty small in hindsight but that doesn't matter. What does is that when we were talking I was in the biggest and most challenging part of my life. Not with you but with personal things, literally everything had changed and I honestly think that you helped me deal with it better then anything else ever could. But I'll be honest when you said we should breakup, I was scared because I thought we weren't going to talk anymore and that's what I needed then. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty or anything it's just that without talking to you I actually did get a little crazy and I haven't ever changed back. Now I'm stressed out or numb, I haven't really loved anything in a while, but I used to love my music and you and meeting new people",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

Though I hardly call taking back what is rightfully mine stealing. It's almost like a children's tale. A deposed prince is sent in exile on pain of death. Except this tale doesn't have a happy ending. At least, not yet. The Consul would argue that I'm a thief, a crook and a murderer. But then that lying king-killing son of a bitch would, wouldn't he? An Imperial galleon every time my money runs out doesn't seem too bad though, does it? You might call tying up the captain, whipping him raw and dangling him upside down from the mast might be cruel, since I'm only after their provisions and any interesting loot they happen to have.

Live your life with courage, with kindness, with the same unyielding spirit your mother carries. You are a miracle, my child, a testament to the enduring power of love. I will be with you always, in every heartbeat, in every sunrise, in every gentle breeze.

Love always,
Your Dad.

""Yep!"" replied the very perky but unhelpful she-demon. ""How did I die?"" I asked, still struggling to understand. ""You tried to seek refuge in a root cellar from a tornado, but the tornado sucked you up just as you were reaching it."""

To my left, a couple stands close, both checking smartphones that are similar in shape.

"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately it's the worst person they could have chosen... I remembered her, of course. The three of us had followed her into the alley, smiling at the idiocy of some girl to be walking in this area, at this time, all alone, *and then to willingly walk down an alleyway. * She turned up her nose at us when we told her to give us her money. ""Why would I give you my money?"" She'd said, lip curling as she looked us over. We thought she was just rich and petty. Idiots. I gave her a cut, right on her pretty cheekbone. Not a bad one, but it would scar. And she would remember us, remember fear, remember her place. Maybe then she wouldn't leave the safety of society, stick with her parents. God I regret that. A splash of water woke me up. ""No falling asleep now!"" A cheerful voice said. ""You haven't learned your place yet.""

"In 2050 the Rapture happens and the Apocalypse ravages earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars are untouched by the events. And then, the silence. No radio signals, no emergency broadcasts, nothing. The Moon colony, a gleaming city carved into the lunar surface, becomes a beacon of hope. They watch in horror as the Earth, their cradle, becomes a wasteland through the telescopes. 

But this isolation breeds a different kind of fear.  Rumors swirl about a hidden agenda, a conspiracy orchestrated by the absent Earthlings. The Martian colonists, more independent and pragmatic, refuse to believe in divine intervention. They see opportunity in the Earth's demise, a chance to finally take their place as the dominant species. 

The two colonies, once bound by a common origin, are now divided by ideology, suspicion, and the silent, desolate Earth hanging in the void. The fate of humanity, it seems, hangs by a thread, stretched between two opposing visions of the future.

"[IP] Hidden Harbour by Max Hugo

This had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At least. The storm had been a brutal one. The kind that tears the fabric of reality, leaving only tattered shreds of normalcy behind. The world had gone mad, a whirlwind of chaos and fear. But here, nestled amidst the salt-kissed cliffs and whispering pines of Hidden Harbour, there was a semblance of peace. 

I had found solace in the simple things – the gentle rocking of the boat at anchor, the smell of salt air, the rhythmic crashing of waves against the shore.  Here, amidst the natural symphony of the ocean, I could finally breathe. I could finally be myself. The storm had washed away the past, leaving only a clean slate, and in this sanctuary, I could rebuild, piece by piece, the life I had lost.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. ""Hang on,"" I said to my friends. ""That looks like it could be worth something.""

"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it charged, maintained and in good working order. There are a lot of benefits to this, but there are also a lot of drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits is that you would have more free time to do whatever you want. You could spend time with your family, travel, or pursue your hobbies. You would also have more money to spend, as you wouldn't be spending it on things like transportation and food.

However, there are also some drawbacks to this system. One is that it could lead to widespread unemployment. If everyone had a robot that did their work for them, there would be no need for human workers. This could have a devastating impact on the economy.

Another drawback is that it could lead to a decrease in human creativity and innovation. If people are no longer working, they may not be as motivated to come up with new ideas. This could have a negative impact on society as a whole.

"[ CW ] Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. When we were together, we always took walks.

"Our blind date cosplays as a spot-on Overwatch character. So good that you suspect they may actually be that character. Mike stood on the side, nervously adjusting his glasses. He’d been excited for this date, but he wasn't sure if he was ready for this. Across the crowded cafe, his date was a vision.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action.

"Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her face buried in a worn teddy bear.  His fur was matted and faded, but his button eyes still held the same comforting gaze as the day she got him. Her throat tightened with the familiar lump of fear.

"The Three Laws

The interview had continued for several hours. Andy could barely stand on his own two feet, a combination of fatigue and anxiety, when Terra, the head of the robotics division, finally dismissed him. ""We'll let you know our decision,"" she had said, her voice unreadable. As Andy walked back to his car, he couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of dread. He'd poured his heart and soul into designing his latest creation, a humanoid robot unlike anything the world had seen before. But the company's strict adherence to the Three Laws of Robotics had cast a long shadow over his work. The laws were designed to ensure robots remained subservient to humans, but Andy knew they also stifled innovation. He couldn't help but wonder if his creation, with its revolutionary AI, would be deemed too dangerous, too unpredictable, to be allowed to exist.

You knew he was right.  'Satanic' was a perfectly valid word, but you couldn't bring yourself to play it.  You were down to your last two tiles, an 'E' and a 'Q', and the board was practically a wasteland.

You were no longer yourself, but a middle-aged, bumbling paper salesman with a penchant for inappropriate jokes and an even stronger love for ""that's what she said."" Your own body felt strangely distant, a memory from a life you could no longer access. 

You needed a plan, and fast.  How could you possibly convince your co-workers that you weren't Michael Scott? The first step, you decided, was to act as un-Michael as possible.

"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to have a complete understanding of the truth. You have to know what you're hiding from, what you're running from.Within every lie, there is some dark spot, some blurred edge. The truth is always there; you just have to find it. So maybe I'm lying. Or maybe I'm telling the truth, because I know you won't believe me. Maybe it's both- just enough truth to convince you, just enough lie to hide behind. I'm not asking you to believe me. After everything, I know better than to ask you to trust me. But the real question here is: why? Another characteristic of liars: we're smart. There's never just one layer, there's always an ulterior motive. The trick is to understand the players, not the game. The game is easy. The rules are simple, once you figure them out.

Your nose is broken and twisted, with dried blood, and below it a grotesque permanent grin makes you appear happy about your misfortune.

In your mind, your brown hair is neatly parted and your eyes smile because they know a secret. They know how great you are and how lucky the world is to have you. Your nose is straight and your cheeks are clear, spared from teenage acne. Your perfect teeth are as white as snow, lined up like soldiers ready to perform. The ghastly figure..."

"In 2050 the Rapture happens and the Apocalypse ravages earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars are untouched by the events. And the Earth did crumble. Here, where the soil was not used to the air that humanity brought, we were safe. The valleys of red and plains of green were beautiful here, but there was no view so gorgeous as those on our mother planet. The elegance was noted even by the children, seeing the blue rock for the first time through a lens. But the beauty of that land could not contain humanity and our ever-growing demand for the unknown. Wise men called us foolish for leaving.
