"Question: Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? Answer: The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.",human,"Is the scope of lymphadenectomy influenced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The occurrence and locations of lymph node metastases remain unchanged by NACT, with non-responders presenting more affected lymph nodes. Consequently, a thorough and systemic lymphadenectomy is necessary for patients receiving NACT followed by surgery, regardless of their response to NACT.","Can neoadjuvant chemotherapy alter the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer cases? The rate and anatomical distribution of lymph node metastases do not change due to NACT, and those not responding clinically have more involved lymph nodes. Therefore, an extensive and systemic lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients undergoing NACT and surgery regardless of treatment response.","Does neoadjuvant chemotherapy affect how extensive lymphadenectomy should be in cervical cancer treatment? The frequency and pattern of lymph node metastases are not influenced by NACT; however, patients who do not respond clinically have more lymph nodes involved. Hence, an extensive systemic lymphadenectomy is recommended for patients treated with NACT and surgery, no matter their treatment response.","Could lymphadenectomy extent be adjusted by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer management? NACT does not modify the frequency or location of lymph node metastases, and clinical non-responders exhibit a higher number of involved lymph nodes. Thus, a comprehensive systemic lymphadenectomy is advised for patients undergoing NACT plus surgery irrespective of NACT response.","Is the extent of lymphadenectomy altered by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in treating cervical cancer? NACT does not affect the distribution or frequency of lymph node metastases, and non-responders show more lymph node involvement. Hence, patients receiving NACT followed by surgery should have a systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy regardless of their response.","Can the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer be changed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy? The frequency and topographic spread of lymph node metastases remain unaffected by NACT; clinical non-responders have more involved lymph nodes. Therefore, systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy is necessary for patients treated with NACT plus surgery, irrespective of response.","Is it possible to modify the extent of lymphadenectomy through neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The occurrence and distribution of lymph node metastases are not changed by NACT; clinical non-responders present more involved lymph nodes. Consequently, a systemic, extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed on patients treated with NACT and surgery regardless of response.","Could neoadjuvant chemotherapy influence the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer treatment? NACT does not alter the frequency or anatomical distribution of lymph node metastases, and non-responding patients have an increased number of involved lymph nodes. Thus, systemic, comprehensive lymphadenectomy is indicated for patients receiving NACT plus surgery, irrespective of response.","Does neoadjuvant chemotherapy modify the necessity for the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer? The frequency and location of lymph node metastases are not altered by NACT, whereas non-responding patients have more affected lymph nodes. Therefore, a thorough systemic lymphadenectomy should be performed on patients undergoing NACT combined with surgery regardless of therapeutic response.","Might the amount of lymphadenectomy be influenced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The rate and topographical distribution of lymph node metastases remain steady after NACT; non-responders have a higher number of involved lymph nodes. As a result, patients treated with both NACT and surgery require an extensive and systemic lymphadenectomy regardless of response to NACT."
