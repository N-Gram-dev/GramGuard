"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night session, sparking outrage among opposition parties and the public alike. The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup.

Critics argue that this bill is a brazen attempt by the ruling party to protect its own interests and maintain its hold on power. It is seen as a way to whitewash the crimes committed by politicians and their supporters during this tumultuous period.

The opposition argues that this amnesty undermines justice and accountability, sending the wrong message to the public that those in power are above the law. They believe that it is crucial for those responsible for any wrongdoing to be held accountable, regardless of their political affiliation.

Proponents of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to heal the deep divisions within society and move forward. They claim that the amnesty will help foster reconciliation and unity among the Thai people, allowing the nation to focus on the future rather than being shackled by the past.

The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.

According to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.

Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure. The researchers have advised authorities to closely monitor the volcano and be prepared for a",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging. He accuses Stephen Farry of a blatantly opportunistic decision to force the college to agree to one of the solutions he proposes for the future streamlining of teacher training",human,"Dr Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning minister, has chosen to eliminate a special premium payment of Â£1.1m that the institution received due to its small size and specialist nature.","The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to withdraw a Â£1.1m premium payment given to compensate for the college's small scale and specialist status.","Dr Stephen Farry, minister for Employment and Learning, has opted to remove a Â£1.1m special premium payment awarded because of the college's small size and specialist designation.","The minister for Employment and Learning, Dr Stephen Farry, has resolved to cut a Â£1.1m premium payment that the college received as compensation for its small scale and specialist role.","Dr Stephen Farry, Employment and Learning minister, has announced the removal of a Â£1.1m premium payment granted due to the institution's small size and specialist status.","The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to stop the Â£1.1m premium payment that was given to the college because of its small scale and specialist nature.","Dr Stephen Farry, minister responsible for Employment and Learning, has chosen to end a Â£1.1m premium payment that compensated the college for its small size and specialist status.","The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has taken the decision to withdraw a Â£1.1m premium payment awarded for the college's small scale and specialist designation.","Dr Stephen Farry, the minister for Employment and Learning, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m that the college received due to its small size and specialist status.","The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has resolved to eliminate a Â£1.1m premium payment given to the college because of its small scale and specialist role."

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the think tank today and highlights a significant educational divide between different regions in the UK.

According to the study, children from disadvantaged backgrounds in London achieved better academic results compared to their peers in the north of England. The research indicates that London's success in narrowing the attainment gap is due to a combination of various factors, including effective policies and investment in education.

The report calls for increased funding and attention to be directed towards schools in the north, in order to bridge the educational divide. The IPPR emphasizes that narrowing the gap is not just about improving individual outcomes, but also about addressing wider social and economic inequalities.

The aim of these de-escalation zones is to reduce violence and create a safe environment for civilians in Syria. However, opposition groups fear that this deal could further divide the country and consolidate the power of President Bashar al-Assad.

The four zones are located in rebel-held areas: Idlib province, parts of Homs province, Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, and the south of the country. While these areas have been heavily targeted by government forces, the opposition argues that the deal fails to address the root causes of the conflict.

Furthermore, there are concerns about the monitoring and enforcement of this agreement. Despite Russia, Turkey, and Iran's involvement, opposition groups are skeptical about their commitment to protecting civilians and ensuring the ceasefire holds.

"The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene.

"Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of fraud and money laundering following a lengthy investigation by the police. The cleric, known for his influential position in the local Muslim community, used his religious status to gain the trust of his followers and exploit their faith for personal gain.

Akhtar, who presented himself as a pious man dedicated to helping others, was found to have siphoned off funds from various charitable organizations under the guise of supporting charitable causes. Instead, the money was used to fund a luxurious lifestyle for himself and his family, including expensive cars and foreign vacations.

The sentencing comes as a shock to the community, who had placed their trust in Akhtar, believing he was using their donations for noble purposes. The judge condemned Akhtar's actions, highlighting the betrayal of the community's trust and the damage caused to the reputation of the Muslim community as a whole.

Slade hopes to make up to three signings during the transfer window to aid the Bluebirds' push for a Championship play-off place, currently four points off the top six. One signing is likely to be a striker after a departure."

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of £1.1m which it was awarding to a specific group of workers. The premium payment, known as the Additional Duties Allowance (ADA), was being given to support staff in the education sector, including caretakers, classroom assistants, and administrative staff.

The decision to remove the ADA has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that the funds can be better utilized elsewhere, such as improving educational resources or investing in teacher training. They believe that the ADA was an unnecessary expense that did not directly contribute to the quality of education.

However, critics argue that the removal of the premium payment will adversely affect the livelihoods of already underpaid and undervalued support staff. They argue that these workers, who play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth running of schools, deserve fair compensation for their additional duties.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace.

The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues.

Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model.

S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain.

Davies believes that S4C should explore alternative funding models, such as partnerships with other broadcasters or introducing advertising, to ensure its long-term sustainability. He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future as a major car rental company announced its plans to expand its electric vehicle fleet. 

Enterprise, the largest car rental company in the United States, revealed that it will be adding 350 electric vehicles to its offering in select cities. This move comes as part of the company's commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. 

The expansion of the electric vehicle fleet will provide customers with a greener alternative for their transportation needs. By opting for electric vehicles, individuals can contribute to a cleaner environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. 

Enterprise's decision also aligns with the global push towards sustainable transportation solutions. Many countries have set ambitious targets to transition to electric vehicles, aiming to phase out gasoline and diesel-powered cars.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that this initiative will alleviate the strain on primary care services and reduce the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in the country's defense policy. The move comes as Japan seeks to redefine its role on the global stage amidst growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.

Under the new legislation, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces will be able to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they can come to the aid of allies under attack. This marks a departure from Japan's long-standing pacifist stance, which restricted its military to defend its own territory only.

The passage of the legislation has been met with mixed reactions both domestically and internationally. Supporters argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in global security, given the changing regional dynamics and the rise of new threats. Critics, however, express concerns about potential constitutional implications and the possibility of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts.

"The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also strong, reflecting a positive trend in Scotland's job market. According to the report, this surge in placements was driven by increased business confidence and a gradual reopening of the economy.

The data revealed that permanent job placements in Scotland rose at the fastest rate since October 2018. This can be attributed to several factors, including the easing of pandemic restrictions and an upturn in hiring across various sectors. The report also highlighted that the demand for temporary staff saw a robust increase, indicating a growing need for flexibility in the workforce.

Furthermore, the report underlined a rise in starting salaries for both permanent and temporary positions. This suggests that employers are competing for top talent as the job market gains momentum. With the reopening of businesses and the vaccination rollout continuing to progress, Scotland's employment landscape appears to be on a positive trajectory.

However, the report also noted that candidate availability continued to decline, posing a challenge for employers seeking skilled workers.

"An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid its rent for the past two years. The shocking revelation came to light during a recent meeting of the Welsh Assembly's Economy, Infrastructure, and Skills Committee.

Cardiff Aviation, once hailed as a beacon of hope for the local economy, has been struggling financially for several years. The company, founded by aviation entrepreneur Bruce Dickinson, leased the hangar at St Athan to carry out aircraft maintenance and training. However, it seems their financial woes have caught up with them.

The committee was informed by an official that Cardiff Aviation had failed to make rent payments for the past two years. This news raises serious concerns about the company's viability and its ability to continue operating at the site. The hangar, which was previously used by the Ministry of Defence, was leased to Cardiff Aviation by the Welsh government in an effort to revive the local economy and create job opportunities.

The failure to pay rent not only reflects poorly on the company's financial management but also raises questions about the Welsh government's decision to lease the",ai,"An official informed a committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has rented a hangar at St Athan since 2012, has not paid rent for the last two years.

"Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices through voice commands. However, Google has now announced that it is expanding the availability of Google Assistant to Android smartphones running on Marshmallow and Nougat operating systems.

This move by Google comes as a response to the growing demand for voice-activated virtual assistants. With Google Assistant now available on a wider range of devices, users will have greater flexibility and convenience in accessing the service. They can now ask questions, set reminders, send messages, and perform other tasks using just their voice.

The expansion of Google Assistant also opens up opportunities for third-party app developers to integrate their services with the virtual assistant. This means users will have access to a wider range of functionalities and capabilities, further enhancing their smartphone experience.

"Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it ""difficult to control his emotions and impulses."" Ben Butler, now infamous for the murder of his six-year-old daughter Elsa, had a history of violent outbursts that were consistently overlooked by the authorities.

Dr Tim Green's assessment of Butler's mental state, conducted nearly two decades ago, paints a disturbing picture of a man struggling to regulate his emotions. Green noted that Butler had a propensity for explosive anger, finding it hard to rein in his impulses.

"Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley.

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands.

Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease.

By planting acorns, Forest Enterprise Scotland hopes to create a sustainable ecosystem that will foster the growth of oak trees and encourage the return of diverse wildlife. This initiative aligns with the Scottish government's commitment to increase woodland coverage and combat biodiversity loss.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to take a leading role in providing long-term financing for green projects in emerging markets. Mr Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of sustainable investments for the stability of the global financial system.

"Tear gas and live bullets were fired to drive back the mainly Shia Muslim crowds, as they protested against corruption and security failures. Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' ""peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt"". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies.

"The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be vigilant and proactive in managing their credit cards to avoid falling into financial distress.

The regulatory body's recent report highlighted that a significant number of credit card users were carrying high balances for extended periods, resulting in substantial interest charges. These customers were often stuck in a cycle of minimum repayments, which barely covered the interest, let alone made a dent in the principal amount.

The FCA emphasized the need for cardholders to regularly review their payments and consider alternative repayment strategies, such as paying more than the minimum amount due or consolidating balances onto lower-interest cards.

In addition, the authority called for greater transparency from credit card providers regarding the long-term costs of carrying high balances. It urged firms to provide clearer information on interest rates and repayment options to help customers make informed decisions.

"Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a ""hoax"" and has repeatedly rolled back environmental regulations during his tenure. However, a group of activists have found a unique way to challenge his stance by borrowing the names of prominent organizations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

These activists, known as ""identity hackers,"" use the credibility associated with these well-respected institutions to criticize President Trump's climate change denial. By adopting these names, they aim to draw attention to the urgent need for action on environmental issues and highlight the stark contrast between scientific consensus and the president's dismissive rhetoric.

"Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits to administering a harmful substance with intent to endanger life. The trial began yesterday at the Oxford Crown Court, where shocking details of the case were revealed.

Julia Knight, a 56-year-old nurse, stood accused of attempting to murder Irene Robson, an 81-year-old patient, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. In a surprising twist, Knight admitted to administering a harmful substance but firmly denied any intention to murder Robson.

The prosecution alleged that Knight had deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, leading to her deteriorating health and subsequent near-death experience. They argued that Knight had harbored a grudge against Robson, although the details surrounding this alleged motive remain unclear.

During the trial's opening statements, the defense acknowledged Knight's administration of the substance but emphasized that there was no intent to kill Robson. Instead, they claimed that Knight had made an error in judgment, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

"The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalize a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no truth to these claims, suggesting that the player was simply seeking attention. 

In a press conference earlier today, Slade explained, ""We have not made any offers to the Heracles forward. I'm not sure why he would make such statements, but it seems like a desperate attempt to generate interest in his services."" 

The player in question has been in impressive form this season, scoring 15 goals in 22 appearances for Heracles. This has led to increased speculation about his future, with several clubs reportedly interested in securing his signature. However, Slade remains adamant that his club is not one of them. 

""We are always on the lookout for talented players, but we have not contacted the player or his club regarding a potential transfer,"" said Slade. ""We have our own targets and are focusing on strengthening the squad in other areas.""

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy.

The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change.

The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality.

If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure indicates that the UK's job market has remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit.

The ONS also revealed that the number of people in employment rose by 99,000 during the same period, reaching a record high of 32.7 million. This suggests that businesses are still hiring and expanding despite concerns about the country's future relationship with the European Union.

However, wage growth remains sluggish, with average weekly earnings increasing by only 3.2% excluding bonuses. This is below the rate of inflation, indicating that workers are not seeing much improvement in their purchasing power.

Experts have attributed the low unemployment rate to a combination of factors, including the rise of the gig economy and more people opting for self-employment. However, concerns remain about the quality of jobs being created, as many are part-time or offer low wages.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed ""ingrained"" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry.

By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%. On Thursday figures showed China's factory output contracting for the first time in six months. Economic growth slowed to a five-year low of 7.3% last quarter.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub.

This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory.

Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats.

Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing. The study highlighted concerns over the narrow focus of police officers, potentially leaving other vulnerable individuals at risk.

The research, which remains unpublished, analyzed the practices of three unidentified police forces in England and Wales. It found that officers were dedicating a significant amount of time and resources to cases involving violence, while other risk factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, and domestic disputes were receiving less attention.

Dr. Sarah Cooper, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of a more holistic approach in policing. She argued that by solely focusing on violent cases, officers may be missing opportunities to intervene and prevent harm in other areas of vulnerability.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea.

The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options.

The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods.

The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support.

The fallout from Hanjin's receivership serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability",ai,"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed.

"The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000. The closure of the facility came as a shock to the local community, which relied heavily on the abattoir for employment and the sourcing of locally produced meat.

Emcol 2008 Ltd had been struggling financially for some time, facing fierce competition from larger meat processing companies and an increasing demand for cheaper imported meat. Despite efforts to streamline operations and cut costs, the company was unable to recover from its mounting debt.

The closure of the abattoir not only resulted in the loss of around 50 jobs, but it also had a significant impact on local farmers who relied on the facility to process their livestock. Many now have to travel further distances to access alternative abattoirs, resulting in increased transportation costs and logistical challenges.

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal troubles. The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates in the upcoming elections, as the party prepares to defend its position in Parliament.

However, much attention is focused on the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal challenges. McGarry was found guilty of embezzling funds from a pro-independence campaign group, while Thompson faced charges of assault and domestic abuse.

The party will have to decide whether to allow these individuals to run as candidates, despite their legal issues. While some argue for forgiveness and second chances, others believe that allowing them to stand as representatives undermines the party's credibility and integrity.

"Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died after being overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning on a boat trip in the Lake District in 2013.

"Spencer Flower claimed his involvement with a social housing company was not relevant to a debate in 2013 over the future of housing in east London. However, newly surfaced documents suggest otherwise.

"That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, according to a report by the Institute for Economic Studies. The staggering figure highlights the immense wealth accumulated by the world's top billionaires.

The report analyzed the net worth of the world's wealthiest individuals and found that the top 1% now control an astounding $6 trillion, equivalent to the GDP of several major economies. This concentration of wealth raises concerns about income inequality and its implications for social and economic stability.

Critics argue that such vast accumulation of wealth exacerbates inequality and hampers social mobility. Income disparities have been a growing concern, with the COVID-19 pandemic further amplifying the divide. The report calls for policy interventions to address the issue, including progressive taxation and increased funding for social programs.

"The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be ""dangerous and reckless"" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances. The proposals will be discussed on 2 December and there will be a full public",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a driving skills evaluation, and a customer service training course for all private hire drivers in the city. The move comes as part of TfL's efforts to ensure a high standard of service and safety for passengers.

The customer service training course would aim to improve the overall passenger experience by providing drivers with essential skills in dealing with customers professionally and courteously.

"The new charity will manage the National Heritage Collection, which includes Stonehenge and Dover Castle. The government currently contributes £22m annually towards the collection. The aim is for the charity to eventually become self sufficient. Other powers such as listing buildings will remain government funded.

The new charity will still be called English Heritage and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection - which include London's Kenwood House, and Charles Darwin's home in Kent - will remain in public ownership. Government funding for the charity will be tapered down from 2015 eventually to nothing, meaning it will have more freedom than now to generate income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations.

"Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there was a growing concern over the number of young people being stopped at airports attempting to travel overseas to join extremist groups.

As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast. The decision by the Parades Commission has sparked controversy and reignited tensions between the Orange Order and the Catholic community.

Critics argue that the restriction is a clear demonstration of religious discrimination, as the parade route has historically included this section of the city. The Orange Order, however, claims that the decision is necessary to avoid potential clashes and maintain order.

The commission's ruling has received mixed reactions from both sides of the divide. Some Protestant groups are supportive, stating that it is a step towards maintaining peace and preventing further violence. On the other hand, Catholic organizations believe that the decision undermines their rights and perpetuates a sectarian divide.

"The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 ""age restricted ... high quality assisted living"" apartments for which it said there was ""a very high need"" for, along with 12 holiday lets.

"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols, as the authorities strive to promote secularism and maintain social stability in the region.
