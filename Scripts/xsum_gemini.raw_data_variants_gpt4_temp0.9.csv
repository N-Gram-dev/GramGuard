"## Police Forces Under Scrutiny for Neglecting Non-Violent Crimes

Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are now being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for potential failings in their handling of non-violent crime, particularly cases related to domestic abuse.

"## London's Red Buses Get a Makeover: Engine Removal Proposed for 142 Idle Vehicles

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal, which will be discussed at the next council meeting, could reach £1 million annually. The initiative, driven by the city's environmental and budgetary concerns, would see the repurposed buses used for static purposes, like advertising or mobile libraries. Critics argue the plan could negatively impact London's tourism industry, which relies on the iconic red buses. Proponents, however, believe the change is necessary to adapt to changing needs and prioritize sustainability. The decision will likely be a hotly contested one, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies.

Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.

UBS made the announcement alongside a report of a 13% rise in fourth-quarter net profit to 963 million Swiss francs, surpassing forecasts. However, the bank warned that the Swiss franc's rise against other currencies, after the Swiss National Bank lifted the cap against the euro, would pressure profitability.

"## TfL Proposes New Driver Tests: Language, Navigation, and Landline Required

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a fixed landline telephone for all new driving licence applications. The proposed changes, aimed at enhancing road safety and driver competence, have sparked debate. 

The English language test would assess comprehension of road signs and traffic regulations, while the map-reading assessment aims to combat reliance on GPS navigation. The requirement for a fixed landline phone is intended to improve communication in emergencies, particularly in areas with limited mobile reception. 

The consultation period, open until [date], invites public feedback on the proposed changes and their potential impact on accessibility and affordability.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: ""If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love."" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall. The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details. TfL says the consultation seeks to ""raise standards across the industry"" following an ""exponential"" growth in the private hire industry and technology. Uber said it was a deliberate target and if the proposals went ahead they would raise prices and increase congestion in London. Gareth Mead, from Uber, said: ""If you think that this is supposed to be a public consultation, well I think the public are not at the heart of the proposals that have been made",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"## Thai Parliament Approves Controversial Amnesty Bill

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sparking protests and raising concerns about the potential for impunity. 

The bill, which aims to reconcile the country after years of political instability, covers a wide range of offences, including those related to the 2010 Red Shirt protests and the 2014 military coup. Critics argue that it would allow for the return of exiled politicians, including Mr Thaksin, and could shield those responsible for human rights abuses. 

Supporters, however, maintain that the amnesty is necessary to move the country forward and bring about national unity. The bill now faces a vote in the Senate, with its fate uncertain.

"## Sunak Accuses Doctors' Union of Spreading ""Misinformation"" 

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced criticism this morning for his handling of the ongoing dispute with the British Medical Association (BMA).  In a heated interview, Sunak accused the BMA of ""playing politics"" and refusing to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" about addressing the current NHS crisis.  He reiterated his offer of a 7% pay increase over the next two years, emphasizing it was the ""fairest and most sustainable"" solution.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave.

"The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the Welsh Government would be consulted on the matter, but there was no requirement for a referendum.  

The party has been accused of breaking its manifesto promise, with opposition parties calling for an immediate referendum. The party has defended its decision, saying that it is in the best interests of the Welsh people.

The funding floor is a controversial policy, with some arguing that it will help to protect public services in Wales. Others have argued that it will lead to a reduction in funding for vital services. 

The debate is likely to continue, with both sides of the argument making their case in the coming months.

"The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park.

"## New Dads Still Missing Out on Paternity Leave, Survey Finds

A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than the minimum legally mandated time off. The findings highlight a continued reluctance amongst new dads to prioritize their own wellbeing and the bonding period with their newborns.  

Experts cite a range of factors contributing to this trend, including societal expectations around masculinity, concerns about job security, and inadequate workplace policies. They emphasize the importance of encouraging men to take advantage of paternity leave, arguing that it benefits not only the father, but the entire family and workplace. The survey calls for increased awareness and support for new fathers, urging employers to foster a culture that normalizes and encourages paternity leave.

"The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, and it was a commercial flop. The game was so poorly received that Atari is said to have buried millions of unsold copies in a landfill in New Mexico. 

The landfill was recently excavated, and the game cartridges were discovered.

"## Charity Aims to Resettle 480,000 Syrian Refugees by Year's End

The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. The ambitious goal, announced yesterday, aims to provide refuge for 480,000 Syrians currently living in precarious conditions in neighboring countries.

They argue that resettlement is a crucial step in offering long-term solutions for Syrian refugees and providing them with a safe and dignified life.

"## Injury Crisis Hits England Back Row Ahead of Crucial Test

England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Ito. The injuries come at a crucial time for the team, who are preparing for their upcoming Test matches. 

Haskell, a veteran of 77 caps, suffered a knee injury during training, while Jones and Williams are recovering from respective hamstring and ankle injuries. Ito, who can play in both the second and back rows, is sidelined with a concussion.

The injuries leave head coach Eddie Jones with a depleted back row, forcing him to look at alternative options for the upcoming fixtures. This setback adds further pressure to an already challenging period for England, who are aiming for a strong performance in the upcoming Test series.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US.

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups.

"## Japan Approves Historic Legislation Allowing Troops to Fight Abroad

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the upper house, represents a significant shift in Japan's post-war security policy. It would allow the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they could fight alongside allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked.

The legislation has sparked controversy, with some arguing it will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts. Others, however, see it as a necessary step to bolster Japan's security in a rapidly changing regional landscape. The move comes amid growing tensions in the East China Sea, where Japan and China have overlapping territorial claims.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located near the city of Kagoshima, is known for its frequent eruptions, which have intensified in recent years. 

A new study published in the journal ""Nature"" reveals that the volcano's magma chamber is expanding, indicating a potential for larger and more destructive eruptions. Scientists are concerned about the increasing frequency of explosive eruptions, which can send ash plumes high into the atmosphere, disrupting air travel and posing risks to surrounding communities.

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the think tank at an event in Manchester today, and examines the disparity in educational attainment between different regions in England. 

The report found that despite facing higher levels of poverty, children in London were more likely to achieve good GCSE results than their counterparts in the north. This was attributed to a number of factors, including better access to high-quality schools, a more diverse range of educational opportunities, and a stronger local economy.

The Parades Commission stated that the decision was made to ""minimize the risk of public disorder"" and ""protect the rights of all communities."" This decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some expressing disappointment and others welcoming it as a step toward reconciliation. 

The Orange Order, which is a Protestant fraternal organization, has announced its intention to comply with the ruling, emphasizing its commitment to peaceful celebrations. The group, however, expressed its concern over the continued restrictions and vowed to continue advocating for the right to march on its traditional route.

The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy.

"##  Rwenzururu King's Medical Privileges Sparks Controversy 

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But the decision to grant him access to a private hospital for treatment has sparked controversy. Critics argue that Mumbere, who is facing charges of treason and murder, should be treated in a public hospital like any other prisoner.

However, the move has fueled concerns about unequal access to healthcare and potential preferential treatment for high-profile individuals.

"## Major Accused of Reckless Driving on Military Base

**Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in a military vehicle on Fort Bragg, North Carolina, putting the safety of other personnel at risk.** The incident allegedly occurred on the evening of October 26th, 2023, during a routine patrol. Witnesses claim to have seen Scott's vehicle swerving dangerously and exceeding the posted speed limit by a significant margin.

"## Man on Trial for Double Manslaughter in Fatal Crash

"The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be ""a retrograde step"" and could ""damage the UK's reputation as a welcoming destination for international students."" 

The proposed changes are part of a wider package of measures aimed at tightening immigration controls. The government argues that the stricter requirements are necessary to ensure that only those with a genuine intention to study in the UK are granted visas. However, critics argue that the changes could deter talented students from applying to UK universities.

The impact of these changes on international student numbers remains to be seen. Some experts believe that the stricter requirements could lead to a decline in applications, while others argue that the UK's universities will remain attractive to students from around the world.

The event was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the shootings, which remain a source of controversy and pain for the community.  The four men, who were all unarmed, were shot dead by soldiers who claimed they were carrying weapons.  However, no weapons were ever found at the scene.  The victims were identified as John McKerr, Brian Friel, Charles McElvogue and Eugene Kelly.  Their families have been campaigning for justice for decades, and the event on Thursday was a chance for them to remember their loved ones and to call for a full and independent inquiry into the shootings.

The families of the men were joined by local politicians and community leaders at the event.  They heard speeches from speakers who called for an end to the cycle of violence and for a more peaceful future.  The event was also a reminder of the ongoing pain and suffering caused by the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

"## S4C's Future Uncertain as BBC Review Looms

S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales that the review was ""long overdue"" and that it was ""time to look at the future of the BBC in the 21st century"". 

The review is expected to consider the BBC's funding model, its role in the media landscape, and its future in a digital world. S4C, which is funded by the BBC, is likely to be affected by any changes made to the BBC's funding. 

The Welsh language broadcaster has already faced funding cuts in recent years, and some have expressed concern that the review could lead to further cuts or even the closure of the channel.

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday.

"## Newsweek Goes Digital: Print Edition to End After 85 Years

The last print edition of Newsweek will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with The Daily Beast in 2010, and the combined entity will continue to publish online and in mobile formats.

“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, which owns The Daily Beast. “The print advertising market is simply not sustainable for a weekly news magazine.” 

The move marks the end of an era for the iconic magazine, which was founded in 1933 and has won numerous awards for its journalism. However, Newsweek's online presence has grown significantly in recent years, with a strong following on social media. The company hopes to reach a wider audience by focusing on digital platforms.

"## Historic Lyndhurst Park Hotel Facing Demolition for Luxury Flats

The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling and visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson, is facing demolition. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a luxury retirement village, sparking outrage from heritage campaigners. 

The hotel, built in the 18th century, sits in a picturesque location near Lymington, Hampshire. It has been a popular destination for centuries, attracting notable figures such as Stevenson, who stayed there in the 1880s. However, the building has fallen into disrepair and has been empty for several years.

PegasusLife argues that the development will ""provide much-needed housing for the elderly"" and create jobs. However, heritage groups have condemned the plans, calling the hotel ""a vital part of local history"" and urging for its preservation. A public consultation is underway, and the fate of the Lyndhurst Park Hotel remains uncertain.
