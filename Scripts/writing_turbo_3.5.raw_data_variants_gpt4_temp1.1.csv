It's become a daily ritual, a testament to your unwavering belief in the existence of these mythical creatures. Some call you eccentric, others simply dismiss it as a flight of fancy.

In the depths of the night, you tiptoe out to the garden, placing the offering under the moonlit sky. Your heart races with anticipation, hoping that tonight will be the night they come. The legends speak of their majestic wings and fiery breath, their ability to soar through the clouds and bring both destruction and protection.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the intricate maze inside our minds. The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain is a captivating piece that explores the depths of human consciousness.

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the remnants of society wander through a desolate wasteland. However, the true battleground lies within their own minds. Each character struggles with their own demons, trapped in a never-ending cycle of fear, regret, and self-doubt.

The author beautifully intertwines the external and internal landscapes, blurring the lines between reality and imagination. As the characters navigate through the physical wasteland, they also delve into the recesses of their own thoughts, confronting their deepest fears and confronting the ghosts of their past.

Thematically, The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain explores the fragility of the human psyche. It questions the notion of what it means to be human when faced with adversity and the weight of one's own mind.

Overall, this story is a thought-provoking journey into the complexities",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done. And I've got to finish the current one which is goal for this month at the very least. We'll see which one I finish editing and decide that I'm comfortable enough with it to try to publish it first. I think maybe I should aim for Goal 2 for the rest of the year. At least a little something. There's a few stories that I'd love to pull into novelette if not novella-length stories. I think world building and outlining are big on my list too this year! I tend to just jump in without doing any sort of world building or outlining of my story.

I have a few stories I’d like to expand into novelette or novella lengths. Additionally, world building and outlining are priorities this year.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

Its themes evoke the ultimate message of The Dark Tower saga. Hana stood out as an intriguing and appealing character, a subtle but strong heroine. The story kept me hooked by making me curious about Hana’s motivation to keep acting heroically despite reluctance. The narrative style seems a bit distant from the action, likely intentionally, since dialogue is minimal. A good example is when Hana speaks with a goon she recognizes from a previous job: > Hana objected as much as she could, but couldn’t form a solid argument.

For example, Hana converse with a goon, once a shop clerk: > Hana made objections as best she could but lacked a coherent argument. Though her thoughts were clear, they sounded like quips.

"Everybody has one soulmate that they are destined to end up with and you know who it is the moment you see them. A doctor has just discovered a groundbreaking scientific theory that challenges this age-old belief. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned psychologist and researcher, has spent years studying human relationships and has put forth a radical hypothesis that challenges the notion of a single soulmate.

According to Dr. Thompson's theory, humans are not limited to one destined partner. Instead, our capacity for love and connection is far more complex. She suggests that we have the potential to form deep connections with multiple individuals throughout our lives, each bringing unique qualities and fulfilling different needs.

This groundbreaking theory has sparked a heated debate within the scientific community and society at large. Traditional romantics argue that true love can only be found in one soulmate, while supporters of Dr. Thompson's theory claim that her research supports the idea that love is abundant, and we are not limited to finding just one person to complete us.

Underworld demons currently suffer from multiple Humanic Possession cases. I challenged each demon's psychic defenses, reshaping their chaotic forms into the steady patterns of the Solomon Keys I had studied for three years. The last and most complex one bore the signature of its name. It screamed, cried, and tried to bounce me back by projecting horrific visions into my mind. Yet I pushed those terrifying projections aside as if lowering the volume on a TV ad and resumed my attack on its protections. Step by step, I unlocked the hidden codes and loosened its grasp until the forms reverted naturally.","It is discovered that Possession is two-sided, allowing us to fight back. Demons from the underworld now face numerous instances of Humanic Possession.

The last defense was more intricate but carried its name's signature. It screamed, wailed, and tried to repel me by sending vivid horror images into my mind.

Every day, I wake up to a world that refuses to understand me. They see me as a monster, an outcast. But deep inside, there is a heart that longs for love and acceptance. I am the misunderstood one, the one they love to hate. My name is Damien.

A bright flash cleaves the sky, slicing through rain as I crouch by my cave. Fear shakes me as I step out, staring at the magnificent view. The sky burns with a fiery glow far away. Craving answers, I follow the bright blaze until I discover a tree set on fire, its limbs engulfed in flames. Crackling sounds mingle with the warmth of this strange blaze, unlike anything I've experienced. I am fascinated.

Reflection 2:

Fire consumes all it touches, altering the world around me. I consider its uses.","Imagine being a caveman discovering fire. These are your journal entries.

Entry number one:
A sudden bright flash bursts across the skies, piercing through the rain while I seek refuge in my simple cave. Afraid but driven by curiosity, I carefully step outside to behold an amazing sight. The heaven's flames flicker in the distance. Drawn forward by wonder, I find a tree consumed by fire, its branches glowing with heat. It crackles loudly, giving off warmth and light unlike anything I know. I'm spellbound.

Entry number two:
The fire enchants me greatly. Its force draws me closer to its flickering dance. I cautiously pass my hand through the warm flames. The tension is sharp and strange, mixed with pain and pleasure. Fire consumes all it encounters, reshaping the nearby world. I meditate on its power.","You are a caveman witnessing fire for the first time. These are your journal notes.

First Entry:
A blazing light shoots through the dark sky, breaking through the rain while I tremble in my modest cave. Fearful yet curious, I step outside and witness an extraordinary scene. The night sky glows with a burning fire in the distance. Drawn onward by intrigue, I approach a tree engulfed in flames. The wood crackles and hisses warmly, radiating a heat and glow unlike anything I have ever known. I am wonderstruck.

Second Entry:
Fire fascinates me deeply. Its dynamic energy pulls me nearer to its fiery dance. I tentatively wave my hand amidst the flickering blaze. The feeling is fiery — a mix of pain and pleasure. The fire consumes whatever it touches, transforming my surroundings. I ponder its meaning."

"I'm fairly certain I've closed my closet door more times than I've opened it... Staring intently at the hole on the other side of the room, Tim knew that he had closed the closet door this morning. Looking into the black crack between pine and an infinite darkness, that stretched into dancing colors when he shut his eyes. It had always been a fear of Tim's- being a boy of only 12 he had overcome many things in his life, but none like this. There was something so bone chillingly sinister about a boy, left alone in his room, to fend off the demons of the night. *Of course monsters aren't real, * Tim thought to himself, covers ascending over his face, *if they were, mommy and daddy would have at least told me how to run away. * Reassuring himself, Tim lowered the covers back below his chin, and turned his head back into the direction of his closet. It had opened wider.",human,"I'm quite sure that I've shut my closet door more times than I've ever opened it... Tim stared intently at the hole on the opposite side of the room, certain he had closed the closet door that morning. Gazing into the dark gap between the pine wood and an endless blackness that shimmered with colors when he closed his eyes, Tim felt his lifelong fear stir. At just 12 years old, he'd faced many challenges, but none like this. Something deeply unsettling haunted the idea of a boy alone in his room, battling the nighttime monsters. ""Monsters aren't real,"" Tim told himself as he pulled the covers over his face, ""and if they were, my parents would have shown me how to escape."" Reassured, he lowered the covers to his chin and looked again toward the closet, only to find the door had opened wider.","I'm pretty sure I've shut my closet door more times than I've ever opened it...

At twelve, he'd overcome much in life but nothing like this—a boy alone in his room, battling the night demons.

At only 12 years, Tim had faced many fears but this one was unique—the dread of a boy alone at night in his room fighting imagined monsters.

Feeling reassured, he lowered the covers and looked again toward the closet that had opened wider.","Tim was fairly certain he'd more often closed than opened his closet door.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Starting a new project, whether it's writing a novel, starting a business, or pursuing a new hobby, can be daunting. The fear of the unknown and the pressure to create something perfect can often paralyze us. But the truth is, the only way to start is to simply begin.

One of the most important things to remember is that the beginning doesn't have to be perfect. It's about taking that initial step, diving into the uncharted territory, and allowing yourself to explore and learn along the way. Embrace the messiness and imperfections, for they are the building blocks of growth and creativity.

Another crucial aspect is setting realistic expectations. Understand that the beginning may be challenging, filled with setbacks and doubts. But it's through these experiences that we learn and improve. Surround yourself with supportive people who will cheer you on and provide constructive feedback when needed.

"You can't tell if are a soldier that dreams he is a ruthless dictator or a ruthless dictator that dreams he is a soldier. It gets really confusing when the lines between reality and illusion become blurred. In the realm of dreams, anything is possible, and one's identity can be muddled, leaving one questioning their very existence.

Imagine a scenario where a soldier, trained to protect and serve, finds himself immersed in a dream where he becomes a merciless dictator, ruling with an iron fist.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common and cheap and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" These words were echoed by Thomas Henderson, a prominent advocate for human rights, as he expressed his concern over the growing acceptance of cybernetic enhancements.

While the majority of society embraces these technological advancements, Henderson believes that the potential consequences are too great to ignore. He argues that the increasing reliance on cybernetic implants may lead to a loss of what defines us as human beings. ""We are blurring the line between man and machine, and it's a dangerous path to tread,"" he warns.

Henderson further expresses his worries about the inequality that may arise from the widespread use of cybernetic enhancements. As these implants become more accessible, those who cannot afford them may be left behind, creating a new form of social divide.

Despite the backlash, proponents of cybernetic implants argue that they are a natural progression in human evolution.

"[ TT ] Heron of Alexandria realizes that his Aeolipile can be used as a steam engine. The industrial revolution begins in the 19th century, with steam power emerging as a driving force behind technological advancements. However, little did the world know that the roots of this revolution can be traced back to the brilliant mind of Heron of Alexandria, an inventor from the ancient world.

It was during his experiments with the Aeolipile, a simple device that used steam to create rotational motion, that Heron stumbled upon a groundbreaking realization. He recognized the potential of his creation, understanding that it could be used as a primitive steam engine. This revelation would forever change the course of history.

The industrial revolution, characterized by rapid industrialization and the shift to machine-based manufacturing, owes its origins to this pivotal moment. Heron's understanding of harnessing steam power laid the foundation for the development of more sophisticated steam engines, which would go on to power factories, locomotives, and ships.

Without Heron's innovation, the world would have been deprived of the tremendous progress and technological marvels that the industrial revolution brought forth.",ai,"Heron of Alexandria discovered that his Aeolipile could function as a steam engine.

Dressing, he left his apartment and discovered Mr. Crawinski atop a step ladder grasping a 75 watt bulb, with two assistants picking up the ladder and walking him counter-clockwise.","Living through the worst potential timeline implies that among the parallel universes of all possible outcomes, there is one filled with misfortune.

The peel moved on as Mortimer decided to upend himself, landing cushioned on the floor. After getting dressed, he left and saw Mr. Crawinski atop a ladder holding a 75 watt lightbulb, moved counter-clockwise by two assistants."

"Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* Ask Lexi #23 - Setting Goals: I'm Aiming for That 3rd Goal. Because While It's Written, It's Not *Finished*

Setting goals is an integral part of achieving success and personal growth. While you may have already put your aspirations into words, merely writing them down is not enough; they need to be nurtured and completed. Aspirations without action are like seeds without water; they won't grow.

Imagine you have set three life goals, and you've managed to achieve the first two. It's admirable, but are you satisfied? Not quite. You yearn for the fulfillment that comes with crossing off that final aspiration from your list. It's the sense of accomplishment that will propel you forward and push you to dream bigger.

So, how do you turn that third goal from a mere statement into a tangible accomplishment? Start by breaking it down into smaller, actionable steps. Identify what needs to be done, set deadlines, and create a plan of action",ai,"Setting goals play a vital role in achieving success and fostering personal development. Writing them down is just the beginning—they must be pursued and completed. Without action, goals are like seeds left dry and unproductive.","Setting targets is key to realizing success and growing personally.

Goals without follow-through are like waterless seeds that fail to sprout.,"To attain success and develop personally, goal setting is essential. Even if your goals are written, they require action and completion. Without practical steps, aspirations are akin to seeds that don’t receive water and thus don’t grow.","Success and personal growth are closely linked to the practice of setting goals. Merely having your goals documented doesn't suffice—they demand active effort to reach completion. Without action, aspirations dry out like seeds lacking water.","Setting goals deeply influences success and self-improvement.

"All people born have a number engraved on their skin, and for the past few centuries, the number has been gradually going down. You are number 3652, one of the last remaining individuals with a four-digit number. It is a peculiar phenomenon that has puzzled both scientists and philosophers alike.

As the number on my skin slowly decreases, I can't help but feel a sense of both wonder and trepidation. What will happen when the numbers run out? Will our identities fade away? Or will a new system emerge to define us?

Some argue that the dwindling numbers signify the diminishing importance of individuality in our society. In a world that increasingly values conformity and homogeneity, our unique numbers serve as a reminder of the diversity we once celebrated.

Others propose that the decreasing numbers are a sign of humanity's collective progress. Perhaps it symbolizes our evolution into a unified global community, where our identities are no longer defined by numerical codes but by our shared values and aspirations.

"""All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!"" ``.... through the gate!"" That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Build a World Part I: Inception Let's begin. Imagine a universe much younger and formed with less violence, containing vastly more mass. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at pressures humans can survive. The sun's heat thins this air to nearly vacuum at its surface, and nearby it heats the gas into plasma. Hot charged gases are blown away along the sun's magnetic poles, which pulls cooler gases inward along a plane perpendicular to those poles, creating a convection current of sorts. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, this current can be unpredictable and even split into multiple currents simultaneously. This combined heat transfer means that while regions near the sun resemble an oven or worse, the habitable zone extends widely. Additionally, solar winds really function as literal winds—nothing trivial about them.","Build a World Part I: Inception Starting off, picture a universe that is significantly younger and formed less violently, with an abundance of mass. The voids between planets contain breathable air at pressure levels suitable for life. Near the sun, heat causes this air to become very thin, nearly approaching vacuum, while at close distances it ionizes into plasma. Charged hot gases flow outward along the sun's magnetic poles, which in turn causes cooler gases to flow inward along a plane 90 degrees offset, creating convection currents. Due to the changing nature of the sun's magnetic field, these currents can be irregular and may overlap or multiply. This convection results in a heat transfer pattern that makes regions adjacent to the sun extremely hot, yet the habitable zone remains vast. Hence, solar winds manifest as genuine winds with considerable force.","Build a World Part I: Inception Here’s a start: envision a universe younger and formed with less violence but with far greater mass. The space separating worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressures. Sunlight thins this atmosphere toward near-vacuum levels at the surface and transforms it into plasma near the star. Hot and charged gases are ejected along magnetic poles of the sun, drawing in cooler gases along an orthogonal plane, inducing a form of convection current. The sun’s magnetic field fluctuates, making these currents unpredictable and sometimes multiple. This convection transports heat so that while close to the sun it’s blistering, the habitable zone spans extensively. Solar winds, therefore, become genuine winds rather than mere particle flows.","Build a World Part I: Inception I'll initiate: Imagine a younger, less violently-created universe with enormously more mass. The void between planets contains breathable atmosphere at pressures humans could survive. The sun’s intensity causes this air to thin nearly to vacuum near its surface, and at nearby distances converts it into plasma. Heated, charged gases move outward along the sun’s magnetic poles, which triggers cooler gases to flow inward on planes roughly perpendicular, generating convection currents. Due to the changing magnetic field, these currents are variable and may be plural or layered. The aggregate heat transfer from this convection leads to extremely hot areas near the sun, yet a very wide habitable zone. In effect, solar winds are true winds in this universe.","Build a World Part I: Inception Let me start by proposing a universe much younger and less violently formed, yet with vastly greater mass. The spaces between worlds hold breathable air under survivable pressures. The sun’s heat reduces this atmosphere to nearly a vacuum close to its surface and ionizes it into plasma nearer distances. Hot charged gases are emitted along the sun’s magnetic poles while pulling in cooler gases on a perpendicular plane, creating a convection-like current. Because the sun’s magnetic field is variable, this current can be unpredictable and multi-layered. Such convection of heat means the sun's vicinity is blisteringly hot, but the habitable zone is extensive. There, solar winds act as actual winds, substantial and forceful.","Build a World Part I: Inception Let's begin by imagining a universe that’s newer and gentler in formation, with much more mass. Between worlds is breathable air at pressures that support survival. Sunlight causes the atmosphere here to thin to near vacuum at the solar surface and to ionize into plasma at close ranges. Hot, charged gases rush away along magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases inward along a plane 90 degrees different, setting up convection currents. Since the sun’s magnetic field fluctuates, so do the currents, which can consist of several at once. This combined heat flow creates extremely hot environments near the sun but an enormous habitable zone. In that setting, solar winds truly become winds.","Build a World Part I: Inception I'll kick off with a universe younger and formed more softly, with substantially more mass. The vacuum between worlds is actually breathable air at life-support pressures. The sun's heat thins this air near its surface to nearly vacuum, heating it to plasma nearby. Hot charged particles are pushed outward along solar magnetic poles, pulling cooler gas inward along a 90-degree-rotated plane, establishing a convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, these currents can be unpredictable, sometimes multiple currents interacting. This convection transports heat such that areas near the sun are extremely hot, but the habitable zone is huge. This makes solar winds actual winds, significant and dynamic.","Build a World Part I: Inception Starting with a premise: a much younger, less violently-created cosmos with far more mass. The inter-world void is filled with breathable air at pressures allowing for survival. The sun’s heat reduces this atmosphere near the surface almost to vacuum and generates plasma at near distances. Hot, ionized gases stream outward along magnetic poles, causing cooler gases to flow inward along a plane perpendicular to these, resulting in convection currents. Due to the variability of the sun’s magnetic field, these currents can be variable and complex. The resulting heat transfer creates blazing zones near the star and an expansive habitable zone. Solar winds thus become real winds.","Build a World Part I: Inception Begin with a younger, less violent universe, with massively more mass than usual. The space between planets is filled with breathable atmosphere at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun dilutes this near its surface to almost vacuum and elevates it to plasma nearby. Hot charged gases are expelled via the sun’s magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases inward perpendicular to that, creating convection-like currents. Because of the sun’s magnetic variability, these flows can be erratic and even multi-directional. The convection heat transfer means areas closest to the sun are intensely hot, but the habitable zone is extensive. Thus solar winds literally are winds in this universe.","Build a World Part I: Inception To start, imagine a universe much younger, less violently formed, and containing far more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressures. The sun’s heat thins this atmosphere near its surface to near vacuum and produces plasma closer in. Hot charged gases vent along magnetic poles, inducing cooler gases to move inward along a plane perpendicular, creating convection currents. Because the sun’s magnetic field fluctuates, these currents can be unstable and multiple at once. This convection results in strong heat transfer, making areas near the star extremely hot but leaving a large habitable zone. Solar winds literally function as winds here."

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry Day 3: First Entry

Dear Diary,

I write these words with a heavy heart, for today marks the beginning of my long and lonely exile. Banished from society for crimes I did not commit, I find myself in this desolate wilderness, surrounded by towering trees and echoing silence.

As the sun rises, I am overwhelmed with a sense of dread and uncertainty. The weight of my unjust punishment hangs heavy upon my soul, and I question whether I possess the strength to endure the trials that lie ahead.

The air is crisp, and the scent of pine fills my nostrils. The sounds of nature, once soothing, now serve as a poignant reminder of the life I have been forced to leave behind. I long for the company of my loved ones, who remain oblivious to my fate.

In this diary, I shall chronicle my days in exile, for I fear that without this outlet, my sanity may wane.

At first, she felt lost and terrified, but as time went on, something inside her sparked a fierce determination. Emily refused to be a victim.

As she grew stronger, so did her resolve to free not only herself but also the countless other beings held captive by the Zorandians.

"The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. Just as she expected, the one on the right was cold. But the third nob.... Grace didn't know what that might be. She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements when she tried on big-girl clothes. So the mystery of the third faucet tap would also be a great surprise when she tried it.

Still, I must reveal the truth to you—I owe you that—even if it destroys my life, this very life. The person you think I am, I am not. It’s difficult to explain simply. I am who you reckon, but also more. I’m your husband, the science teacher at school, the man who brought you flowers recently.
