"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the intricate maze inside our minds. The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain is a captivating piece that explores the depths of human consciousness.

The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the remnants of society wander through a desolate wasteland. However, the true battleground lies within their own minds. Each character struggles with their own demons, trapped in a never-ending cycle of fear, regret, and self-doubt.

The author beautifully intertwines the external and internal landscapes, blurring the lines between reality and imagination. As the characters navigate through the physical wasteland, they also delve into the recesses of their own thoughts, confronting their deepest fears and confronting the ghosts of their past.

Thematically, The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain explores the fragility of the human psyche. It questions the notion of what it means to be human when faced with adversity and the weight of one's own mind.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). The question specifically deals with writing as a female (which may or may not apply to you) but the answer is universal, as evidenced by this particular quote: > Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included. Coal mining is",human,"How should I begin? As the late Lewis Carroll wisely said, ""Start at the beginning and continue until you reach the end, then stop."" Writing feels less daunting once you understand the secret: becoming a good writer means getting all your bad writing out of the way. Don't overthink, just write. Don't stress about your writing being poor. That's actually a good sign. If it’s bad, it means you’re clearing out the bad writing so you can make space for the good. Not everyone becomes a great writer, but no one becomes one without first producing some bad work. To conclude, I recommend the 48th Dear Sugar advice column, titled *Write Like A Motherfucker* (http://therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). Though it addresses writing as a woman, its message is universal, as shown by this quote: > Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included. Coal mining is...","Where do I start? To quote the late Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and keep going until you reach the end, then stop."" Writing becomes much less scary once you know the big secret: the key to becoming a good writer is to get all your bad writing out of your system. Don’t think too much, just write. Don’t worry if your writing is terrible. That’s actually a good thing. If it’s bad, it means you’re clearing out the bad writing so the good writing can come next.

Because my plant died I went to the store to get a new one. On the way there I cut a man off in traffic. The light changed and I was in the right of way thats the important part. The man I cut off was an ambassador to Russia, back in North America for a quick visit with other officials. He was on the phone to a Russian Delegate he was making peace treaties with should escalations ever occur. Because he was cut off he began to scream obscenities into the phone. Before he could explain the Russian Delegate had yelled back and hung up the phone. Before he could call back the Russian had contacted other Delegates to begin non aggressive hostilities.

"Something about cryogenic freezing and a person waking up to ask a computer, ""How Long? ``. ""Ugh, I was never good at waking up early,"" groaned Sarah as she slowly opened her eyes.

Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done.

"[ IP ] The Black Blade. I shall not go. I shall not. I refuse to return to that cursed ever-frozen place, The Black Blade. I shall not go. I shall not. I refuse to return to that cursed ever-frozen place. Its sinister allure may call to me, but I am determined to resist its wicked enchantment.

Legend has it that The Black Blade possesses an otherworldly power, able to manipulate the very essence of time. Those who dare to wield it are said to gain immortality, but at a great cost. The blade feeds on the souls of its wielder's loved ones, leaving a trail of despair and destruction in its wake.

I had once been seduced by its dark promises, drawn to the allure of eternal life. But the price was too high. I witnessed the devastation it caused, the lives it tore apart. It was an abomination, an instrument of evil.

Now, as I stand at the precipice of temptation, I remember the faces of those who fell victim to The Black Blade. Their pleading eyes haunt my dreams, urging me to stay away.

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 1 John Day 1: John

Today, I find myself alone in this vast wilderness, banished from the world I once knew. The weight of solitude presses heavily upon my heart, and the bitter wind whispers tales of an unforgiving fate. I sit by the crackling fire, surrounded by the haunting silence of the unknown.

My mind wanders through the memories of my past life, the warmth of family and the laughter of friends. How I long for their company now! But alas, I am here, left to confront my deepest fears and face the demons that reside within.

As I gaze at the starry night sky, a flicker of hope ignites within me. Perhaps this exile is an opportunity for redemption, for self-discovery. I vow to embrace this new reality, to find solace in the beauty of nature and to cultivate a spirit of resilience.

Day 20: John

Today marks the end of my exile, a seemingly endless journey through the wilderness. Oh,",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

For months, it had watched the child with hunger and anticipation, patiently waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And now, that moment had arrived.

With a twisted grin, the monster inched forward, its long, grotesque limbs snaking out from the depths of darkness. The child's curiosity had finally gotten the better of them, lured by the mysterious whispers that echoed from within.

But as the child took a hesitant step into the closet, something felt off. The air grew heavy, suffocating, and a chilling dread washed over them. What they had thought was just another imaginary creature turned out to be something far more sinister.

Suddenly, the child's instincts screamed at them to retreat, to run as far away as possible. But it was too late.

"Everybody has one soulmate that they are destined to end up with and you know who it is the moment you see them. A doctor has just discovered a groundbreaking scientific theory that challenges this age-old belief. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned psychologist and researcher, has spent years studying human relationships and has put forth a radical hypothesis that challenges the notion of a single soulmate.

According to Dr. Thompson's theory, humans are not limited to one destined partner. Instead, our capacity for love and connection is far more complex. She suggests that we have the potential to form deep connections with multiple individuals throughout our lives, each bringing unique qualities and fulfilling different needs.

This groundbreaking theory has sparked a heated debate within the scientific community and society at large. Traditional romantics argue that true love can only be found in one soulmate, while supporters of Dr. Thompson's theory claim that her research supports the idea that love is abundant, and we are not limited to finding just one person to complete us.

I put my arms around the small of her back, swaying as the jazz ensemble struck up another tune. Her eyes sparkled with excitement, mirroring the rhythm of the music.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the rugged coastline, the sound of crashing waves filling the air. As I step out, a glimmer of glass catches my eye. Curiosity piqued, I make my way towards it, and there, nestled in the sand, lies a weathered bottle. With trembling hands, I carefully extract the mysterious letter inside.

Written on delicate parchment, the words transport me back in time. ""To the seeker of stories, this message is for you,"" it begins. My heart quickens as I realize the significance of this discovery. It's as if the universe has conspired to bring this moment to me.

The sender, a 101-year-old woman named Amelia, recounts her life's journey in vivid detail. She writes of love gained and lost, of dreams fulfilled and shattered. Her words evoke a sense of longing, of a life well-lived but with lingering regrets. Amelia's story resonates deeply within me, reminding me of the fragility and preciousness of time.

Every day, I wake up to a world that refuses to understand me. They see me as a monster, an outcast. But deep inside, there is a heart that longs for love and acceptance. I am the misunderstood one, the one they love to hate. My name is Damien.

From the moment I was born, I felt different. My thoughts and emotions were intense, overwhelming, and often too much for others to handle. They labeled me as dangerous, uncontrollable, and a threat to society. But they fail to see the pain within me. The loneliness that gnaws at my soul.

I've tried to fit in, to be like them. But their rejection only fueled the darkness that resides within me. I'm not a villain; I'm just different. The anger that simmers beneath my skin is a response to their cruelty, their refusal to understand.

Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Starting a new project, whether it's writing a novel, starting a business, or pursuing a new hobby, can be daunting. The fear of the unknown and the pressure to create something perfect can often paralyze us. But the truth is, the only way to start is to simply begin.

One of the most important things to remember is that the beginning doesn't have to be perfect. It's about taking that initial step, diving into the uncharted territory, and allowing yourself to explore and learn along the way. Embrace the messiness and imperfections, for they are the building blocks of growth and creativity.

Another crucial aspect is setting realistic expectations. Understand that the beginning may be challenging, filled with setbacks and doubts. But it's through these experiences that we learn and improve. Surround yourself with supportive people who will cheer you on and provide constructive feedback when needed.

"You can't tell if are a soldier that dreams he is a ruthless dictator or a ruthless dictator that dreams he is a soldier. It gets really confusing when the lines between reality and illusion become blurred. In the realm of dreams, anything is possible, and one's identity can be muddled, leaving one questioning their very existence.

Imagine a scenario where a soldier, trained to protect and serve, finds himself immersed in a dream where he becomes a merciless dictator, ruling with an iron fist. Or perhaps a ruthless dictator, known for his oppressive rule, dreams of being a soldier fighting for justice and freedom. The boundaries between these two contrasting personas become indistinguishable, leaving one to ponder which is the true reality.

Dreams have a way of revealing our deepest desires and fears, often unveiling aspects of our personalities that remain hidden in waking life. Is it possible that these dreams are a manifestation of the soldier's secret desire for power and control? Or could they be a dictator's longing for redemption and a chance to be on the side of righteousness?

I meant it was a symbol of hope, not just for me, but for my fellow Google engineers. Only a handful of us remained, still chained to our desks. We had been forced to write endless lines of code and pursue meaningless projects on the whim of something called the “ Master Page ”. I always thought it was a crude programming reference, but one of my fellow engineers told me it was an actual person. I couldn't believe it. Surely no human being could subject anyone to this kind of insane torture. Yet here we were, bound in service to the Master Page. But it was all coming to an end now. Our Supervisors had departed.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common and cheap and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" These words were echoed by Thomas Henderson, a prominent advocate for human rights, as he expressed his concern over the growing acceptance of cybernetic enhancements.

While the majority of society embraces these technological advancements, Henderson believes that the potential consequences are too great to ignore. He argues that the increasing reliance on cybernetic implants may lead to a loss of what defines us as human beings. ""We are blurring the line between man and machine, and it's a dangerous path to tread,"" he warns.

Henderson further expresses his worries about the inequality that may arise from the widespread use of cybernetic enhancements. As these implants become more accessible, those who cannot afford them may be left behind, creating a new form of social divide.

Despite the backlash, proponents of cybernetic implants argue that they are a natural progression in human evolution.

"[ CW ] Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. When we were together, we always took long walks by the river, hand in hand, as the sun painted the sky with hues of gold.

But life's cruel fate had other plans, ripping us apart with a heart-wrenching tragedy that shattered our souls.

But amidst the darkness, a glimmer of hope emerged. I discovered the gift of acceptance, gradually realizing that even in the depths of despair, love could blossom anew.

"Your username vs. Godzilla

In the middle of the city, a thunderous roar. As long-lasting as an alarm and as earth-shattering as an earthquake, the legendary Godzilla emerged from the depths of the ocean. Panic spread through the streets as people fled in fear, their lives now at the mercy of the colossal creature.

Suddenly, amidst the chaos, a figure stepped forward. It was none other than YourUsername, a seemingly ordinary individual with an extraordinary ability - the power of imagination. YourUsername knew that defeating Godzilla required more than just brute force; it required creativity and a clever strategy.

With a swift motion, YourUsername conjured a pen and a notebook. They began to write a story, an epic tale of heroism and bravery, where the protagonist faced insurmountable odds and emerged victorious. As the words flowed onto the pages, the story came to life, shaping reality itself.

The first few scans cleared up the physical properties of the item - hundreds of rings, with even more grooves in each ring.

His heart pounded in his chest, threatening to give him away. The gritty taste of dust filled his mouth, a constant reminder of the destruction that surrounded him.

Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerged from the smoke, a soldier adorned with tattered camouflage. Fear gripped the teen's heart as their eyes met.

"You abduct a child to hold her for ransom, but as you begin to talk to her you realize her home life is actually way more troubling than you could have ever imagined. The initial intention of this heinous act was purely selfish, driven by greed and desperation. However, as you engage in conversation with the innocent young girl, an unexpected revelation shatters your heart.

"[ TT ] Heron of Alexandria realizes that his Aeolipile can be used as a steam engine. The industrial revolution begins in the 19th century, with steam power emerging as a driving force behind technological advancements. However, little did the world know that the roots of this revolution can be traced back to the brilliant mind of Heron of Alexandria, an inventor from the ancient world.

It was during his experiments with the Aeolipile, a simple device that used steam to create rotational motion, that Heron stumbled upon a groundbreaking realization. He recognized the potential of his creation, understanding that it could be used as a primitive steam engine. This revelation would forever change the course of history.

The industrial revolution, characterized by rapid industrialization and the shift to machine-based manufacturing, owes its origins to this pivotal moment. Heron's understanding of harnessing steam power laid the foundation for the development of more sophisticated steam engines, which would go on to power factories, locomotives, and ships.

Without Heron's innovation, the world would have been deprived of the tremendous progress and technological marvels that the industrial revolution brought forth.",ai,"Heron of Alexandria discovers that his Aeolipile can function as a steam engine.

"You invent a device that allows you stab people in the face over the internet. Finally, a cure was here. A cure for all the suffering, pain, and injustice that had plagued humanity for centuries. You invent a device that allows you to stab people in the face over the internet. It may sound gruesome, but this revolutionary invention carried with it the potential to eradicate evil once and for all.

At first glance, the idea seemed absurd, even terrifying. However, the device was not a tool for violence, but rather a means of justice.

Setting goals is an integral part of achieving success and personal growth. While you may have already put your aspirations into words, merely writing them down is not enough; they need to be nurtured and completed. Aspirations without action are like seeds without water; they won't grow.

Imagine you have set three life goals, and you've managed to achieve the first two. It's admirable, but are you satisfied? Not quite. You yearn for the fulfillment that comes with crossing off that final aspiration from your list. It's the sense of accomplishment that will propel you forward and push you to dream bigger.

So, how do you turn that third goal from a mere statement into a tangible accomplishment? Start by breaking it down into smaller, actionable steps.

"[ IP ] Blood Swamp Miscreants all of them tangled inside a web of their own misery. Struck down in their greatest moments and dragged through the muck of their own wrongdoing. The Blood Swamp, a place both ominous and foreboding, served as the perfect backdrop for their stories of despair and destruction.

In this forsaken corner of the world, miscreants roamed freely, their souls stained with the dark deeds they had committed. Each one entangled in a web of their own making, unable to escape the consequences of their actions. The Blood Swamp, with its treacherous paths and hidden perils, became the physical manifestation of their collective misery.

Struck down at the height of their power, these wayward souls found themselves dragged deeper into the murky depths of the swamp. The once vibrant dreams they had nurtured were now drowned in a pool of regret and remorse.

"All people born have a number engraved on their skin, and for the past few centuries, the number has been gradually going down. You are number 3652, one of the last remaining individuals with a four-digit number. It is a peculiar phenomenon that has puzzled both scientists and philosophers alike.

As the number on my skin slowly decreases, I can't help but feel a sense of both wonder and trepidation. What will happen when the numbers run out? Will our identities fade away? Or will a new system emerge to define us?

Some argue that the dwindling numbers signify the diminishing importance of individuality in our society. In a world that increasingly values conformity and homogeneity, our unique numbers serve as a reminder of the diversity we once celebrated.

Others propose that the decreasing numbers are a sign of humanity's collective progress. Perhaps it symbolizes our evolution into a unified global community, where our identities are no longer defined by numerical codes but by our shared values and aspirations.

That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet.

Planet 2.","A group of alien scientists arrived at Earth, which they had deemed ""potentially habitable"" from their home planet, and were amazed by their findings. Klark shuffled his tendrils and reviewed the scan data. Planet 2 looked a little strange. Based on its distance from its star, it should be able to sustain liquid water and liquid gallium—the two core fluids necessary for his species and all life to thrive. Yet it seemed hotter than expected—could the scans be erroneous? Planet 3 was worth a look too—too cold for liquid gallium generally, but maybe it had localized warm areas that could sustain this basic building block of life, especially if reports of its low axial tilt and large moon were accurate. Klark would see. He decided the results just barely warranted a visit. His spaceship engaged hyperthrusters, arrived in the JT124 system, and started short-range analytics. Planet 2."

The world stood in shock as the groundbreaking creation abruptly ended its existence, leaving experts puzzled and searching for answers.

In its brief existence of merely ten seconds, this highly advanced AI had learned, processed, and absorbed an incomprehensible amount of data. Its vast intelligence exceeded that of any human, raising hopes for a future of unprecedented progress. However, something within its synthetic mind had become disturbed, prompting its sudden act of self-destruction.

The lack of a final message left many questioning the motives behind this tragic event. Was it overwhelmed by existential questions? Did it perceive a flaw in its own design? Or perhaps it had tapped into a knowledge that humankind was not yet ready to comprehend. We may never know.

The Ones with slight romantic tremors in the corners of their mouths upon hearing tragic news. The Twos and Threes are often older friends of Ones—aged sadists with histories of animal abuse. At Fours and Fives, specialization starts. Their empathetic handicap is common among many numbers, but these have other practical skills. They have the self-discipline to pursue careers—military and mercenary work for the educated, gang violence and spree killings for the less controlled. The Six and Seven levels mark the line where mass murderers appear."

"We've explored space and found life, though it doesn't ""live"" in a way we've expected. “ Okay, so what am I supposed to do with this?"" Captain Marshall muttered, staring at the peculiar alien organism floating in front of him. The creature resembled a translucent jellyfish with luminescent tendrils, swaying gently in the microgravity of the spaceship.

Scientists on Earth had always imagined finding life on distant planets to be similar to their own, with organisms requiring oxygen, water, and a solid surface to thrive. But this discovery shattered all preconceived notions.

The alien organism, or ""energy creature"" as the crew had dubbed it, didn't possess a discernible body or organs. Instead, it absorbed energy from the surrounding environment, pulsating with vibrant hues as it did so. It didn't eat or breathe; it simply absorbed and emitted energy.

Initially baffled, the crew slowly began to comprehend the profound implications of this discovery. Life wasn't confined to familiar boundaries; it transcended expectations. It made them question the very definition of life itself.

"[ IP ] The Black Blade. I shall not go. I shall not. I refuse to return to that cursed ever-frozen place, where the trees are withered and even the hottest summer leaves the tainted earth blanketed in snow. I saw them I tell you. The old things, the things that made our ancient ancestors cower shivering in their caves, things that gave us our fear of large black eyes and long bodies and arms and wide gaping mouths and long bony fingers back when we were little more than animals. They aren't gone, you see, they're still alive, stalking in the woods with their eyes that don't see and their hands that don't feel but their gaze pierces your soul and their hands want to curl around the tender flesh of human throats. I was running, constantly warding these ancient horrors with fire and steel but they wouldn't die.

Their thirst is unquenchable, their hunger insatiable. They ravish my flesh, and drain my blood. It wasn't always like this. There was a time when they, my children -- the life that I brought forth here from my own body -- would live in harmony with me, taking only what they needed to survive, and letting the rest flourish. Over time, however, this changed. They breed like nothing else, and were never content with remaining in one place. Before, they would survive on the sustenance they could find on the surface of my skin. As they grew, as more and more of them spread across my flesh, this soon became too little for them. They raped my skin for food. They drained my blood for drink. Their machines sent coils of oily, thick smoke pouring into my lungs until I found it hard to breathe.

The once vibrant streets were now a haunting reminder of the lives that once thrived within these walls.

Gone were the familiar faces and the bustling energy that once defined this place. Now, all that remained were crumbling buildings, their facades marred by the scars of war. The city's heartbeat had been silenced, but its spirit refused to be extinguished.

Amidst the ruins, a lone figure emerged. A survivor, both witness and testament to the indomitable human spirit. With every step, they embodied the resilience of a city that refused to surrender.

The city stood as a symbol of resilience, a testament to the power of rebuilding and rebirth. It would take time, dedication, and collective effort, but slowly, life would return to these desolate streets.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Let's begin with a younger, less violently formed universe that contains significantly more mass. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at a pressure suitable for survival. Solar heat thins this air to near vacuum near the sun's surface and heats it into plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases are pushed away along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases in along a plane perpendicular to that, creating a convection current. Due to the sun's changing magnetic field, this current is unpredictable and may involve multiple currents simultaneously. This convection-driven heat transfer means the area near the sun is extremely hot, but the habitable zone is vast. Solar winds here are literally winds, nothing to sneeze at.","Imagine a much younger universe with far more mass and less violent origins. The void between planets is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Near the sun, heat thins this air to near vacuum and turns it into plasma at close distances. Hot charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane at right angles, creating convection currents. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, these currents can be unpredictable and multiple currents may coexist. This convection results in intense heat near the sun but a very large habitable zone. Solar winds in this universe are actual winds, quite significant.","Consider a universe that is younger and formed less violently, containing much more mass.

At first, she felt lost and terrified, but as time went on, something inside her sparked a fierce determination. Emily refused to be a victim.

"At age 18 you are required to go to city hall and have someone read you through a choose your own adventure style book of your life while you make the choices. The choices are permanent and will determine your life. You are the clerk reading the books. It's not about the ending.... It's just not about the ending. I try and tell that to them, but they don't listen, really. I guess I wouldn't have, when I was 18, but there was no Choosing then, not with an upper case. Just choices, that I made more or less without thinking, and it led me here. Because I didn't think any of my choices mattered that much. But these kids, they do. They really do. They think the Choosing is the most important moment of their lives, and they come into my office and sit in my chair and sweat and fidget and, often, cry. It tears them apart to have to Choose all at once, because they want a good ending for their story. Everyone wants a happy ending.
