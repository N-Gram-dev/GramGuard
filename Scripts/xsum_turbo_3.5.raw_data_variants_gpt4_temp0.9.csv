"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years.

The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.

According to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.

Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure. The researchers have advised authorities to closely monitor the volcano and be prepared for a",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been reduced by 25 basis points to stimulate economic growth and boost lending. The move by the central bank is aimed at providing relief to businesses and consumers amidst a slowdown in the economy.

The decision comes as the country grapples with trade tensions and weakening domestic demand. The central bank hopes that the rate cut will encourage borrowing and investment, ultimately supporting growth.

Critics argue that the amnesty would permit human rights abuses to remain unpunished by granting immunity to officials and protest leaders.","The amnesty pertains to offenses committed during the political unrest after Mr. Thaksin was removed in a coup. The controversial bill was passed by the lower house early Friday and now moves to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the bill's approval could lead to street demonstrations. Although it abstained from voting, the bill passed overwhelmingly with 310 votes to none. BBC's Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head notes that the Senate's approval is uncertain because half its members are appointed, but the bill might pass next week, potentially causing further protests. Proponents say the bill will end the political turmoil caused by the 2006 military coup that deposed Mr. Thaksin, which left Thailand deeply divided. The turmoil included the 2008 Bangkok airport occupation and two months of 2010 street protests that resulted in about 90 deaths, mostly civilians.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace.

The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues.

Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society.

The survey findings have sparked calls for employers to reassess their policies and offer more extensive and flexible paternity leave options.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model.

S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain.

Davies believes that S4C should explore alternative funding models, such as partnerships with other broadcasters or introducing advertising, to ensure its long-term sustainability. He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that this initiative will alleviate the strain on primary care services and reduce the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.

The new service, known as ""Pharmacy First,"" allows patients with minor ailments to directly access advice and treatment from their local pharmacist, without the need for a doctor's appointment. Pharmacists are trained professionals who can provide guidance on managing common illnesses and offer over-the-counter medication recommendations.

By directing patients to pharmacies instead of doctors, NHS England aims to decrease the burden on general practitioners and prevent the over-reliance on antibiotics for illnesses that do not require them. Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern worldwide, and it is crucial to preserve their effectiveness for when they are truly needed.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in the country's defense policy. The move comes as Japan seeks to redefine its role on the global stage amidst growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.

Under the new legislation, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces will be able to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they can come to the aid of allies under attack. This marks a departure from Japan's long-standing pacifist stance, which restricted its military to defend its own territory only.

Supporters argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in global security, given the changing regional dynamics and the rise of new threats.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: ""If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love."" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall.

TfL says the consultation seeks to ""raise standards across the industry"" following an ""exponential"" growth in the private hire industry and technology. Uber said it was a deliberate target and if the proposals went ahead they would raise prices and increase congestion in London.

"Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices through voice commands. However, Google has now announced that it is expanding the availability of Google Assistant to Android smartphones running on Marshmallow and Nougat operating systems.

"Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley.

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands.

Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease.

By planting acorns, Forest Enterprise Scotland hopes to create a sustainable ecosystem that will foster the growth of oak trees and encourage the return of diverse wildlife. This initiative aligns with the Scottish government's commitment to increase woodland coverage and combat biodiversity loss.

"The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park.

The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber.

"Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits to administering a harmful substance with intent to endanger life. The trial began yesterday at the Oxford Crown Court, where shocking details of the case were revealed.

Julia Knight, a 56-year-old nurse, stood accused of attempting to murder Irene Robson, an 81-year-old patient, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. In a surprising twist, Knight admitted to administering a harmful substance but firmly denied any intention to murder Robson.

The prosecution alleged that Knight had deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, leading to her deteriorating health and subsequent near-death experience. They argued that Knight had harbored a grudge against Robson, although the details surrounding this alleged motive remain unclear.

During the trial's opening statements, the defense acknowledged Knight's administration of the substance but emphasized that there was no intent to kill Robson. Instead, they claimed that Knight had made an error in judgment, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen. Only 2% of Britain's population were B negative, but hospitals had used 6% more of this blood type in the past last four weeks than the same period last year, said the NHSBT.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms."" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would ""slip through the net"".

The charity will have the flexibility to explore innovative revenue streams, while ensuring that these treasures of national heritage remain accessible to the public.

"Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was ""awful"" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy.

The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change.

The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality.

If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed ""ingrained"" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave. Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. ""The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,"" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. ""Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave."" He said there remained a ""cultural expectation"" within organisations that women rather than men will be the ones taking extended periods away from the workplace.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub.

This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory.

Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats.

Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries.

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets.

"The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded the campaign group Cure the NHS, has recently claimed that the care at Stafford Hospital was so dire that some patients were reduced to drinking water from vases.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing.

"On 30 January 1915, England played Scotland in a charity match organised by former England international and Northampton Saints captain Edgar Mobbs. The aim of the match was to raise funds for the British Red Cross Society and support the war effort during World War I.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea.

The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options.

The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods.

The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support.

"The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000. The closure of the facility came as a shock to the local community, which relied heavily on the abattoir for employment and the sourcing of locally produced meat.

Emcol 2008 Ltd had been struggling financially for some time, facing fierce competition from larger meat processing companies and an increasing demand for cheaper imported meat. Despite efforts to streamline operations and cut costs, the company was unable to recover from its mounting debt.

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal troubles. The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates in the upcoming elections, as the party prepares to defend its position in Parliament.

However, much attention is focused on the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal challenges. McGarry was found guilty of embezzling funds from a pro-independence campaign group, while Thompson faced charges of assault and domestic abuse.

The party will have to decide whether to allow these individuals to run as candidates, despite their legal issues. While some argue for forgiveness and second chances, others believe that allowing them to stand as representatives undermines the party's credibility and integrity.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a driving skills evaluation, and a customer service training course for all private hire drivers in the city.

"Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his controversial bid for a third term, leading to widespread protests and subsequent crackdowns.

The police accused them of jeopardizing national security by reporting on armed groups operating in the country.
