"When you die, you don't go to the afterlife of your religion, you go to the afterlife of the religion whose tenets you followed most. This thought-provoking twist on spiritual destiny places emphasis not on our expressed beliefs, but on our actual conduct throughout life. It implies that our actions, rather than our stated affiliations, determine where our soul will reside posthumously. This places a mirror before us, compelling us to reflect on whether our deeds truly align with our professed faith. It might be an unsettling concept for some, a reminder that the disconnect between faith and everyday behavior can potentially lead to an unexpected hereafter. It asks us to consider if we are living out the true essence of our beliefs, or if we are merely hiding behind the name of a religion. It’s a profound concept that highlights the importance of not just professing faith, but also living it.",ai,"When a person dies, they don't enter the afterlife of the religion they claim to belong to, but rather the afterlife of the religion whose principles they actually practiced the most. This intriguing perspective on spiritual destiny stresses the importance of one's actions over expressed beliefs. It suggests that our true conduct, not our declared religion, guides the soul's journey after death. This idea forces us to examine if our behaviors genuinely reflect our stated faith. It can be unsettling, reminding us that a gap between faith and behavior could lead to an unexpected afterlife. It urges us to question whether we truly embody our beliefs or just use our religion's name as a cover.

This forces us to reflect on the alignment between our actions and our stated faith. It could be disconcerting for some, revealing the risk of a mismatch between faith and deeds.

This perspective invites introspection on whether our actions truly reflect our faith. It might unsettle some by pointing out possible disparities between belief and behavior. It challenges us to evaluate if we are living the core of our religion or merely adopting its name. The concept powerfully underscores the importance of living one’s faith in practice.","When you pass away, your soul goes not to the afterlife of the religion you say you follow, but to that of the religion whose principles you have lived by most closely. This thought-provoking idea shifts emphasis from verbal belief to actual conduct. It suggests that our afterlife is shaped more by our deeds than by our expressed religious affiliation. This notion holds a mirror to our lives, prompting us to assess if our actions align with our professed faith. It may be unsettling as it exposes potential gaps between belief and behavior that could affect our final destination. It encourages us to live authentically according to our faith instead of merely claiming it.","After death, individuals do not enter the afterlife of their declared religion but rather of the faith whose teachings they truly followed in life.

It indicates that our deeds, not our declared affiliations, decide where our souls reside after death. This demands reflection on whether our behaviors uphold our professed faith. It may be unsettling as it reveals the risks of hypocrisy between belief and action. It encourages living faith authentically rather than superficially claiming it.","Upon passing, the soul does not go to the afterlife of the religion one claims but rather that of the religion whose teachings one has truly lived by.

This challenges us to consider if our lived behaviors truly mirror our faith. It may discomfort some by exposing contradictions between words and deeds. It emphasizes the need to embody one’s religion genuinely.","When a person dies, their afterlife is determined not by the religion they profess but by the religion whose principles they have most genuinely followed through their actions. This perspective places importance on actual conduct rather than verbal profession of faith. It suggests that where one ends after death is a reflection of how they lived more than what they claimed to believe. It serves as a mirror, urging honest reflection on the alignment of faith and deeds. This can be unsettling, highlighting the dangers of disconnecting belief from practice. It calls for living faith authentically, not merely stating it.",Death leads one not to the afterlife of their declared religion but to that of the religion whose tenets they have truly embodied in life. This profound concept shifts the focus from professed faith to actual behavior in determining spiritual fate.

"You are a member of an alien race headed to Earth. Your mission? Glass the planet. However, one unsuspecting animal stands in your way, the humble honeybee. The Earth's flora, which we hoped to convert into silicon, is pollinated by these tiny creatures. Their demise could cause an ecological catastrophe, endangering our mission. So, we decide to attempt communication. 

We learn from these bees, their way of living, their dedication, their communal spirit.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In the realm of fiction, this maxim stands as an authentic beacon of wisdom. But if we delve deeper, it uncovers a paradox. For, in fiction, the beginning is not always at the start, and the end is not always where you stop. Instead, the canvas of imagination is loomed with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending at its own accord. It is where time is manipulated, blending past, present, and future in a tapestry of tales. It is where reality is an illusion, and illusions form the reality, making boundaries blur and often disappear. Yet, despite these complexities, the essence of storytelling in fiction remains simple. As Carroll suggests, it is about beginning, continuing, and ending - a journey where the start could be the end, and the end, a new beginning. One only needs to remember to stop when they come to the end.",ai,"How should I begin? Lewis Carroll, the celebrated author, advised, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This advice holds true in fiction, yet it reveals a paradox: beginnings aren't always at the start, nor are endings where you might expect. Fiction weaves a complex tapestry of characters, plots, and settings, each with unique starts and finishes. Time bends, mixing past, present, and future into a story that blurs reality and illusion. Nonetheless, storytelling remains fundamentally about beginning, continuing, and ending — with starts that can be ends and ends that can be new beginnings, as Carroll said, provided you stop when the story concludes.","Where do I begin? Lewis Carroll once said, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In fiction, this guidance acts as a wise beacon, though it carries a paradox: the beginning isn't always at the start, nor does the end always signify stopping. Fiction's realm is a woven fabric of characters, plots, and settings, each with its distinct start and finish. Time flows fluidly, merging past, present, and future into a seamless narrative where reality and illusion intermingle. Despite this, storytelling's core remains straightforward — start, proceed, and finish — with the beginning sometimes serving as the end, and the end as a new beginning, stopping only at the conclusion.","How do I begin? The late Lewis Carroll famously advised, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This principle is a guiding light in fiction, yet it unveils a paradox: the beginning may not be at the start, and the end isn't always the final stop. Fiction crafts a rich tapestry of characters, plotlines, and settings, each with independent beginnings and endings. Time is flexible here, blending past, present, and future into stories where reality and illusion merge. Still, the essence of storytelling is simple: start, move forward, and end — with beginnings that can be ends and ends that can birth new beginnings, as Carroll implied, stopping once the tale is done.","So, how do I start? Lewis Carroll famously stated, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This advice is a true cornerstone in fiction, though it hides a paradox: beginnings aren't always at the outset, nor ends where you cease. Fiction is a complex weave of characters, plots, and settings, each with its own independent start and finish. Time is manipulated, blending the past, present, and future into a tapestry where reality and illusion intertwine. Yet, storytelling remains fundamentally about starting, continuing, and ending — where starts can be ends, and ends, new beginnings, stopping only when you reach the end.","Where to start? Lewis Carroll's words, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop,"" serve as a timeless guide in fiction. However, this guidance reveals a paradox: beginnings don't always appear at the start, and endings aren't necessarily final. Fiction is woven with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings that each have their own start and finish. Time bends and blends past, present, and future, creating a narrative where reality and illusion become indistinguishable. Still, the essence of the craft is clear—begin, continue, and conclude, understanding that sometimes the beginning is the end, and the end, a new beginning, stopping only when the tale finishes.","How to begin? According to Lewis Carroll’s timeless advice, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This principle holds great truth in fiction, though it also poses a paradox: a story's start isn't always at the beginning, nor does an end always mean stopping. Fiction is a complex interlace of characters, plots, and settings, each following unique beginnings and endings. Time flows in a non-linear way, mixing past, present, and future, blurring lines between reality and illusion. Yet, the core of storytelling remains simple: begin, proceed, and stop at the end, embracing that the start may be the end and the end a new beginning.","Wondering how to start? The late Lewis Carroll advised, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In fiction, this advice shines as a true guiding light but presents a paradox: beginnings are not always at the start, nor ends always where one stops. Fiction spins intricate webs of characters, plots, and settings, each initiating and concluding in their own time. Time itself is fluid, merging past, present, and future into a narrative where reality and illusion blend. Despite this complexity, storytelling's heart remains simple: begin, continue, and conclude — the start might be the end, and the end a fresh beginning, provided one stops when the story ends.","How do you start? Lewis Carroll famously said, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This maxim is a beacon in fiction, yet it uncovers a paradox: the beginning is not always at the start, nor is the end always where you stop. Fiction is a rich tapestry woven from characters, plots, and settings that each have their own start and finish. Time is malleable, blending past, present, and future into a story where reality and illusion coexist. Still, the essence of storytelling is straightforward: start, carry on, and stop at the end, acknowledging that sometimes the start is the end and the end a new beginning.","Where does one begin? As Lewis Carroll advised, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This advice stands as a true guide in fiction, yet reveals a paradox: beginnings may not always be at the start, and the end isn't always the final point. Fiction interlaces characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending independently. Time is pliable, mixing past, present, and future into a seamless narrative where reality and illusion merge. Nevertheless, storytelling's essence is simple: start, continue, and finish — where beginnings can be ends, and ends, fresh beginnings, stopping once you reach the conclusion.","How can I begin? Lewis Carroll's famous words, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop,"" serve as a guiding principle in fiction. Yet, this guidance exposes a paradox: the beginning may not be at the start, and the end might not be the final stop. Fiction is a complex weave of characters, plots, and settings, each with unique starting and ending points. Time is fluid, blending past, present, and future into a narrative where reality and illusion blur. Despite these complexities, storytelling's core remains simple: start, proceed, and conclude — understanding that starts can be ends, and ends can be new beginnings, stopping only when the story ends."

"You can't tell if are a soldier that dreams he is a ruthless dictator or a ruthless dictator that dreams he is a soldier. It gets really confusing because the line between reality and fantasy begins to blur. The images in your dreams are so vivid and the emotions so raw, it's as if they are a tangible part of your existence. Each night, as a soldier, you command legions of men on the battlefield, wrestling with the weight of responsibility and the crushing reality of war.

"A genie grants you one wish, so you wish to meet the girl of your dreams. There's a flash and in a moment standing in front of you is a girl, bathed in an ethereal glow. She radiates beauty, intelligence, and kindness, her every feature embodying your deepest desires. Her eyes hold the wisdom of the world, twinkling as if mirroring a galaxy far, far away. Her laughter, akin to a harmonic symphony, infuses warmth into the most frigid corners of your heart. Her smile, enchanting as a new dawn, promises a thousand shared joys and solace in times of sorrow. Meeting her feels like finding a missing piece of your soul. The genie had indeed granted your wish and handed you a dream. But as time passes, you realize that a dream, while enchanting, is nothing more than a phantom. The girl, as perfect as she may be, is not real.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common, cheap, and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" That was the vehement reaction of Samuel Marsh, a dedicated Luddite and activist, to the latest development in this field. He's part of a shrinking minority who fear that humanity is losing its essence in the endless drive towards technological advancement.

For them, the idea of replacing an arm, an eye, or even a kidney with synthetic, machine components is nothing short of a nightmare. For the rest of us, the wonders of cybernetic technology are a lifeline, a chance at a normal life, even an improved life.

Imagine being free from the threat of degenerative diseases, from the specter of disability. Sadly, those like Marsh can't see past their fear of the new and unknown. The reality is, technology is not the enemy of humanity; it's a tool that can make our lives better, if we let it",ai,"Society has advanced to a stage where cybernetic implants are widespread, affordable, and remarkable.

"[ CW ] Write so that the first letters of each sentence spell out WRITINGPROMPTS. ""With love also comes hatred"" ""With love also comes hatred,"" is a phrase often forgotten in the euphoria of companionship. Rarely do we think about the flip side of affection - a battlefield of emotions that can turn love into disdain. It’s not all roses, but it's part of the human experience. Too often, we forget that love is more than just passion and warmth. 

In essence, love is a complex cocktail of emotions. New lovers may not comprehend the depth of these feelings until they're knee-deep in them. Great romances have been built and shattered on this very foundation. 

Promising beginnings can lead to bitter endings. Relationships are a constant learning curve. Over time, you realize that love is not just about happiness and joy. Moments of anger, hurt and sadness are intertwined with those of joy and fulfillment. 

Prompts such as these help us reflect on the intricacies of love. They remind us that love, in its rawest form, is beautifully complicated.

The soldier slowly lowers his weapon and reaches out a calloused hand, revealing a brief moment of humanity amid the devastation. Despite being adversaries, their shared suffering unites them and highlights human resilience."
"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to have a complete understanding of the truth. You have to know what you're hiding from, what you're running from.Within every lie, there is some dark spot, some blurred edge. The truth is always there; you just have to find it. So maybe I'm lying. Or maybe I'm telling the truth, because I know you won't believe me. Maybe it's both- just enough truth to convince you, just enough lie to hide behind.

"This isn't home, but it'll do. The hot midday sun glared down on me from up above, a condemning sneer as I leaned against a crumbling stone wall. Sweat dripped from my brow, my throat parched, my eyes squinting at the relentless light. The streets were empty; everyone had retreated indoors, seeking refuge from the brutal desert heat.

"Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals

The 3rd goal is more than just words on a page. It's about imbuing every paragraph, every sentence, every word with purpose, resonating with the reader on a level that's more than just superficial. It's about the long hours spent in solitude, punctuated by cups of coffee, and the eternally blinking cursor on a blank page.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was carrying an invisible burden. Her name was Clara, and she was the one who had witnessed it all: The day Death died. 

Just hours ago, she had come across a grim, shadowy figure, collapsed in a quiet alley. It was Death, the infamous harbinger of the end, now at his own end.

"There are food critics and movie critics. Then there's you: the serial killer critic. 'The hardest part, I find, is not the research or the analysis, but the detached approach one must maintain. It's a deadly profession, not in the physical sense, but in its psychological impacts.

As a serial killer critic, I must understand the minds and methods, not to glorify them, but to elucidate the twisted world they inhabit. I delve into the chilling details of their macabre acts, examining them under the harsh lens of critical analysis to extract patterns, motives, and perhaps even signs of remorse. 

This isn't without its dangers. The nightmares, the constant looking over the shoulder, the bizarre understanding of the dark abyss that is the human mind, it takes a toll. But there's a perverse sense of satisfaction in confronting and analyzing this darkness, in aiming to derive some knowledge from the chaos.

It was a shock, a morbid curiosity filled with dread. The sense of mortality, often abstract, became chillingly concrete. Your heart pounded as your death unraveled before your own eyes. It was not violent or heartbreaking, but natural, peaceful even. However, the tranquility did not ease the unsettling reality that death was inevitable, it was coming, one day. The experience was surreal, like watching a movie of your life's final chapter. It was a wake-up call, a reminder to cherish every moment, every breath. In an uncanny way, it was a boon.

You were praised as a liberator, but your reflection showed the harsh truth—the beastly glare in your eyes and blood-stained hands painted a grim picture. Today you accepted that you were not the hero, but the antagonist. The boundary between good and evil was blurred by subjective truth, and you unknowingly crossed it. In seeking heroism, you became the very monster you vowed to defeat."

"A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your significant other goodbye and head out to the dusty road, your heart heavy with nostalgia. A chill wind brushes past, whispering tales of love, laughter, and silent tears that the old abode has witnessed. The sky, an eternal spectator, casts a solemn gaze upon the world below.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere",human,"Let's begin with a younger, less violently formed universe containing much more mass. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at a survivable pressure. The sun's heat thins this air to near vacuum close to its surface and heats it into plasma nearby. Charged hot gases are pushed away along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane at 90 degrees, creating convection currents that can be multiple and unpredictable due to the sun's magnetic variability. This convection causes significant heat transfer, making areas near the sun extremely hot, but vastly expanding the habitable zone. Solar winds here are literal winds and can be powerful, except far from the sun. The increased mass results in more planets, all forming within an atmosphere.","Imagine a younger universe formed with less violence but containing much more mass. The void between worlds holds breathable air at survivable pressures. Near the sun, heat reduces this air to near vacuum and converts it to plasma. Hot charged gases escape along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases along a perpendicular plane, creating complex, possibly multiple convection currents due to the sun's ever-changing magnetic field. This convective heat transfer makes the sun’s vicinity scorching, but greatly enlarges the habitable zone. Here, solar winds function as actual winds, substantial except at great distances. This greater mass allows for more planets, all birthed in an atmosphere.","Consider a much younger, less violently created universe that contains a vastly greater mass. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at pressures humans could survive. The sun’s heat reduces this air to near vacuum at its surface and heats it to plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases are pushed away along the sun’s magnetic poles, which draws cooler gases in along a plane at right angles, producing a convection current that can be unpredictable and multilayered due to magnetic variations.

Between worlds, there’s breathable air at a pressure suitable for survival. Heat from the sun thins this air to near vacuum near its surface and converts it to plasma at close distances. Hot charged gases are pushed out along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane perpendicular to that, generating convection currents. Because the sun’s magnetic field varies, these currents are unpredictable and may consist of multiple flows. The overall heat transfer from this convection renders the sun's vicinity extremely hot, but substantially enlarges the habitable zone. Solar winds here are actual winds and can be formidable except at great distance. This greater mass means more planets form in an atmosphere.","Start with a younger, less violently originated universe with substantially more mass. The gap between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure levels. The sun's heat reduces this air to near vacuum close to its surface and turns it into plasma nearby. Hot charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, simultaneously pulling in cooler gases along a plane at 90 degrees, creating a convection current. Due to the sun's magnetic field fluctuations, this current can be unpredictable and possibly multiple.

The space between worlds consists of breathable air at a pressure humans can tolerate. Heat from the sun thins this air to near vacuum near its surface and heats it into plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases move away along the sun’s magnetic poles, simultaneously drawing in cooler gases along a plane perpendicular to those poles, creating convection currents. Due to the dynamic nature of the sun's magnetic field, these currents may be multiple and unpredictable.

"Write an erotic story using the worst slang terms possible for each act/body part. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like an eternity. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like hours, my mind a whirl of confusion and curiosity. 

In front of me lay the most perplexing piece of literature I'd ever come across. Covertly disguised as a naughty narrative, this piece was a bewildering mix of the most bizarre slang terms known to human language. It read like a field guide for misunderstood metaphors, a treasure trove of naughty nomenclature. 

Each sentence was a head-scratching enigma. The author had tossed away the conventional norms of erotic fiction and dived headfirst into the realm of the unconventional. The body parts were expressed through a smorgasbord of wildly imaginative metaphors that left you blushing, chuckling, or utterly baffled.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry Day 3: First Entry

Today marks my first day in this vast, unending wilderness. My only companions are towering trees and distant mountains, their immense stillness echoing my isolation. Survival, once a distant concept, is now my reality. I spent the day gathering berries and hunting for edible roots. Water, thankfully, is abundant thanks to a nearby stream. The solitude is both peaceful and terrifying, a paradox of emotions I cannot fully grasp. I wonder if this newfound silence will drive me mad or if it will serve as a haven from the chaos of my previous life.

"You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years, you've become jaded and bored, robbed of the thrills and uncertainties that make life worth living. Death, an unknown abyss for most, holds no more mysteries for you.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry I don't know where to begin. I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually. We were blindfolded soon after we were taken, so I don't have a clear idea of where I exactly am. All I know is that we're on our own. Thirty separated into ones. I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies. This is the last thing I've found in it, along with a dull pocket knife, a canteen water bottle, a pen and some thin string, which I've been using for snares.
