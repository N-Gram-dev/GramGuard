The voice echoed again, anticipation building. ""Rain or shine, I need shelter!"" he cried, his desperation spilling over. The door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow.  ""Come in,"" the voice said, a hint of warmth replacing the previous gruffness. The traveler stepped inside, leaving the relentless rain behind.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Let's begin with a universe that's much younger and formed less violently, possessing vastly greater mass. The space between worlds contains breathable air at survivable pressure. Solar heat thins this air to near-vacuum near the sun's surface and elevates it to plasma at closer distances. Charged hot gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward along a plane perpendicular to this, creating a convection current. Due to the sun's complex magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may consist of multiple simultaneous currents. This convection results in significant heat transfer, making the region near the sun extremely hot, but greatly expanding the habitable zone. Consequently, solar winds are literally wind and quite noticeable.","Imagine a younger, less violently formed universe with significantly more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at safe pressure levels. Near the sun, the heat thins this air to near vacuum and transforms it into plasma closer in. Hot, charged gases are pushed out along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases inward along a plane at right angles, causing a convection current. The sun's variable magnetic field makes this current unpredictable and potentially composed of multiple currents at once. This convection leads to extensive heat transfer, turning regions near the sun into ovens, but vastly enlarging the habitable zone. Thus, solar winds are quite literally wind and not negligible.","Consider a universe that is younger and formed with less violence, yet contains much more mass. The spaces between worlds are filled with breathable air at pressures that support life. The sun's heat decreases the air density near its surface to near vacuum and heats it to plasma closer by. Hot charged gases get expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, which simultaneously draws cooler gases inward along a perpendicular plane, generating a convection current. The sun’s changing magnetic fields cause this current to be complex and possibly composed of several currents at once. The combined heat transfer makes the area close to the sun extremely hot but enlarges the habitable zone significantly. As a result, solar winds are genuinely wind and quite strong.","Let's start with a universe that's younger and less violently created, with a significantly larger mass. The voids between worlds hold breathable air at a pressure that allows survival. Solar heat thins this air to near vacuum near the sun’s surface and raises it to plasma nearby. Hot charged gases are pushed out along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward along a plane perpendicular to that, forming convection currents. Due to the sun’s varying magnetic field, these currents are unpredictable and may overlap. This heat transfer means areas close to the sun become extremely hot, but the habitable zone expands greatly. Therefore, solar winds are literally wind and quite potent.","Imagine a universe much younger and formed less violently, with much more mass present. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at a survivable pressure. Heat from the sun reduces this air to near vacuum near its surface and converts it to plasma nearby. Hot charged gases flow outward along the sun’s magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases inward along a plane at right angles, creating convection currents. The unpredictable magnetic field of the sun can cause multiple currents simultaneously. This results in significant heat transfer, making the sun’s vicinity an oven but the habitable zone enormous. Hence, solar winds truly behave like wind and are notable.","Let's envision a younger, less violently formed universe packed with much more mass. The void space between worlds is filled with breathable air at a pressure that supports survival. The sun’s heat thins this air near its surface to almost a vacuum and heats it into plasma near the sun. Charged hot gases are ejected along the sun’s magnetic poles and draw cooler gases inward along a perpendicular plane, forming convection currents. The dynamic nature of the sun’s magnetic field means these currents can be complex and multiple at once. This convection transfers enough heat so that while the sun’s surroundings are scorching, the habitable zone is vast. Thus, solar winds are literally wind and quite significant.","Consider a universe that's younger and created less violently, with greatly increased mass. Spaces between worlds contain breathable air at survivable pressure. Near the sun, heat thins the air to nearly vacuum and transforms it into plasma. Hot charged gases are pushed away along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward at right angles and creating convection currents. Because the sun’s magnetic fields vary, these currents can be unpredictable and may be multiple at the same time. This heat transfer makes the areas near the sun extremely hot but the habitable zone very large. Therefore, solar winds are genuinely wind and quite strong.","Think of a much younger and less violently formed universe with significantly greater mass. The void between worlds contains breathable air at a livable pressure. Sun heat thins this air to near-vacuum near its surface and energizes it into plasma closer in. Charged hot gases are forced out along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases along a plane perpendicular to that, creating convection currents. The sun’s magnetic field fluctuates, causing these currents to be unpredictable and multiple.

"It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Poss. A young baker named Penelope, famous for her award-winning sourdough, has taken residence in the soul of Beelzebub, the Lord of Flies, causing him to obsess over yeast starters and sourdough recipes. In the fiery depths of Tartarus, Cerberus, the three-headed dog, has been overtaken by the spirit of a yoga instructor, leading to an endless cycle of howling downward-facing dog poses. And in the palace of Hades, the King of the Underworld himself has been possessed by a retired opera singer, forcing him to belt out mournful arias in the halls of the damned. This new wave of Humanic Poss, a divine twist of fate, has turned the tables on the supernatural world, leaving demons bewildered and powerless against the overwhelming human spirit.

At twelve years old, he'd conquered many things but none like this. There was something chilling about a young boy left alone in his room to face the demons of the night. *Monsters aren't real,* Tim thought while pulling the covers over his face, *if they were, Mommy and Daddy would have told me how to run away.* Comforted, he lowered the covers and looked back at the closet, now open wider.","I'm pretty sure I've closed my closet door more times than I've opened it... Tim stared intently at the hole across the room, knowing he had shut the closet door that morning. Gazing into the dark crack between pine wood and infinite darkness that turned into changing colors when he closed his eyes, Tim faced a fear that had always unsettled him. At just 12 years old, he had overcome many fears, but none quite like this one. There was something sinister about a boy alone in his room facing the demons of the night. *Monsters aren't real,* Tim thought as he pulled the covers over his face, *if they were, Mom and Dad would have at least told me how to escape.* Feeling reassured, he lowered the covers to his chin and turned back toward the closet, which was now open wider."

Dear Mariana, 

This may not be your number anymore but I don't care. I just need you to know. I was a fool to let you go. I was scared, I was insecure, I thought you were too good for me. But now, looking back, I realize how much I loved you, how much I still love you. You were the light in my darkest days, the reason I smiled even when everything felt wrong. I miss your laugh, the way you'd tilt your head when you were thinking, the way your eyes would sparkle when you were happy.  

I wish I could take it all back. But I can't.  All I can do is write this letter, hoping you might somehow read it. 

Always,

Though my cheeks were all unshaven My mind was set to plunder. Within my sights, that treasured goal Of riches, fame, and glory. And yet, alas, not one single soul Would live to tell the story. I felt not fear, not now, not yet, As we sailed through forbidden waters. Though I'd soon begin to flit and fret As the air around grew hotter. The sun burned without respite And my arms turned crimson red. Time slowly creeped by until that night As I carefully crept into bed. My dreams that night were vivid As sweat soaked through my sheet. A girl appeared, quite livid And one refrain she did repeat: “ There's reason for those who stay away From these waters in which you reside. If you do not turn back within a day Then you shall surely die ” I woke from this dream in a panic, Not sure of my place or the time. My mind was filled with thoughts",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"## A Man, a Wilderness, and Two Diary Entries

**Day 1**

I. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The sun bleeds through the canopy, casting the forest floor in a tapestry of light and shadow. I stand at the edge of the wilderness, the boundary between civilization and exile.  A cold wind whips through the trees, carrying with it the whispers of my shame.  Twenty years.  Twenty years to atone for my crime, to live amongst the creatures that fear me more than the men I wronged. The wilderness is a harsh mistress, but I must embrace her embrace, for she is my only sanctuary now.

**Day 7300**

I. The sun sets on the horizon, painting the sky with fiery hues of orange and crimson. The air is still, filled with the gentle chirping of crickets. I sit on a moss-covered rock, a weathered journal in my lap. My fingers, gnarled and calloused, trace the words I have written over the years. A lifetime in this wilderness.  My exile is almost over, and the world outside, once familiar, now seems alien.  I have become one with the forest, a creature of the wild.  But will I be welcomed back to the world of men? Or am I destined to forever be a prisoner of my past, even as I am freed from this prison of nature?

This harsh wilderness is my only sanctuary, and I must learn to embrace it.","The air around me is rich with pine and moisture as daylight breaks through the canopy, lighting up the forest floor in contrast. I stand at the border between human society and the wild, feeling the cold wind that carries my shame like a whisper through the trees.

The wilderness is stern, but I must accept her embrace as my solitary refuge.","The smell of pine needles and damp earth fills the forest air.

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020. It was a nice neo-Victorian in the middle of the city. A bit overpriced, but the location was perfect.  The previous owners, a family of five, were quiet and kept to themselves.  They didn't seem the type to build secret passageways, but there it was - a smooth, steel door behind a false bookcase in the basement. The only way I discovered it was when I tried to move some boxes and the bookcase shifted, revealing the door. Curiosity got the better of me. I pulled the door open. 

The elevator was small, just enough for one person. The controls were simple: a single button with a single arrow pointing up. With a hesitant breath, I pressed the button. The elevator lurched into motion. Where it was going, I had no idea.

"## A Creation Myth: The Dance of Light and Shadow

Long ago, before the world was, there lived only a being of pure light. This being, shimmering and radiant, yearned for companionship, for something to share its brilliance with.  But in its solitude, the light grew afraid of its own immensity. It yearned for a counterpoint, a balance. 

One day, the light, in its infinite desire, decided to divide itself. It split into two – one remaining pure and radiant, the other becoming the opposite: cold, dark, and still.  The light, now known as the sun, danced across the void, painting the darkness with its brilliance.  But the darkness, known as the moon, held its own, refusing to be consumed.  And so, the dance began. 

Day after day, the sun chased the moon across the sky, painting the world in vibrant hues and then retreating, allowing the moon to bathe it in its cool, silver light. This eternal chase, this constant interplay of light and dark, became the rhythm of the world, the very essence of life.  And so, the sun and moon, forever intertwined, became the source of the day and night, the creators of the world as we know it.

"An angel has now been exiled from both Heaven and Hell. Apparently causing one little tiny apocalypse is enough to get one fired in that town, and not.  They’d have had more sympathy if she’d managed to level a city, apparently. Not that she was sorry. In fact, she felt quite pleased with herself.  After all, she’d merely rearranged a couple of planetary alignments, creating a minor solar flare that had fried a few communication satellites. It wasn't her fault if the resulting power outage had caused the entire global economy to grind to a halt. She was merely fulfilling her destiny, as a bringer of chaos.  

Now, she was stranded on Earth, a planet of mud and grass and creatures that ate each other.

The disc vibrated faintly, a low hum that resonated through the chamber.

My tail thumped a desperate beat on the silent alley ground. I licked his face in an attempt to awaken him, but he barely flinched. His hand, usually warm and strong, lay limp beside him. The sharp, raw scent of his fear filled the air. I whimpered softly, feeling helpless in the deepening darkness. His eyes, once bright and lively, appeared dull and distant. I moved closer, trying to provide some warmth, comfort, and hope. He was my whole world, and now he was slipping away."
"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately, it's the worst person they could have chosen…

I remembered her, of course. The way her eyes, usually bright and lively, had hardened into something cold and calculating. The faint scent of ozone that clung to her like a second skin. The way she moved, with a fluid grace that belied the raw power she held within. 

She turned, her gaze sweeping over the four of them, and a low chuckle escaped her lips. It wasn't a friendly sound, more like a wind whipping through a graveyard. 

“Well, well,” she said, her voice a silky whisper that held a dangerous edge. “Look what the tide has washed in. I was wondering when you lot would show up.” 

The leader, a hulking man with a face that looked like it had been carved from granite, swallowed nervously. “We just wanted your wallet, lady.”

“You just wanted my wallet,” she repeated, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “And what makes you think I'd give it to you?” 

The alleyway suddenly felt very small, very cold, very dangerous.

"## A Man in the Wilderness

**Day 1:**

The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and fear. I'm alone, banished to this forsaken wilderness, my life stripped bare, my future an empty canvas. The forest whispers secrets I don't understand, and the shadows seem to hold judgment. I built a meager shelter, a flimsy shield against the unknown. A single tear rolls down my cheek, leaving a salty trace on my skin. Twenty years. I can barely fathom the immensity of that time.

**Day 7,300:**

The sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and fading purple. This final sunset is different. I don't feel fear, only a quiet acceptance. The wilderness has been my teacher, my tormentor, my solace. I have learned to survive, to endure, to find beauty in the stark simplicity of life.  The forest, once a prison, now feels like home. It's time to return. I am not the same man who walked in all those years ago. I am stronger, wiser, more at peace.  And I carry the wilderness with me, forever etched into the landscape of my soul.

Cast away and alone, my life stripped down and my future empty. The forest seethes with secrets I cannot grasp, while shadows seem to pass judgment. I built a weak shelter as protection.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end."" 

It's a deceptively simple concept, yet the beginning can be the most daunting part of writing a story. Fear not, fellow storytellers! The secret lies in your imagination. Let a single image, a whispered phrase, or a fleeting thought ignite your creative spark. It could be a flickering candle in a dusty attic, the scent of cinnamon on a chilly night, or the rustle of leaves in a silent forest.

Once you have your seed, let it grow. Explore the world it suggests, delve into the emotions it evokes, and let the characters unfold before you. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. So, begin at the beginning, let your pen dance, and let the magic of storytelling weave its spell.

## The Hound of the Baskervilles, Retired

The once-sharp scent of blood had dulled to a faint, dusty whiff. Sherlock Holmes, his keen mind now a haze of forgotten deductions, sat hunched in a dusty armchair, clutching a lukewarm cup of tea. The London fog, once his ally in concealing his movements, now clung to him like a shroud.  

His flat, once a haven of intellectual pursuits, was now a cluttered haven of despair. The violin lay silent, its strings forever tuned to the melody of forgotten triumphs. The magnifying glass, a symbol of his brilliance, lay shattered on the floor, reflecting only the dim glow of a single candle.

This Czarnian, a flamboyant fellow named Zorp, was expecting something like a swamp planet, a place where sentient cacti worshipped a giant space rock. What he got was a bustling, technologically advanced planet with a global network and a thriving social media scene.  

""You have… internet?"" Zorp asked, his three eyes wide with disbelief as you explained the concept of the internet, social media, and the various streaming services available. You explained that Earth was a democracy, with free speech and a vibrant political scene. He laughed, a raucous, throaty sound, ""Democracy? What is this, a joke?"" 

It turned out Earth, despite its advanced technology and global interconnectedness, was considered a pariah in the galactic community. The reason? Our tendency to hoard information and technology, our fear of contact with the ""unknown,"" and our general paranoia about extraterrestrial life.

Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no stars, only vast, swirling nebulae? Imagine a universe where the very fabric of space is alive, pulsing with a gentle, luminescent energy. This energy coalesces into swirling clouds of gas and dust, each one unique and constantly changing. Instead of planets, there are vast, organic islands of land, floating on currents of the nebulae. Life, in this universe, takes the form of bioluminescent creatures, their bodies shimmering and pulsing like the nebulae themselves.

The fabric of space is vibrant and alive, pulsing with a gentle luminescent energy that forms into unique, shifting clouds of gas and dust. Instead of planets, there are large organic islands floating on nebular streams. Life takes the form of bioluminescent beings whose bodies shimmer and pulse like the nebulae, linked by a collective mind communicating through subtle patterns of light.

"## Day 1.

The world shrieks behind me, a cacophony of shouts and laughter, now fading to a distant hum. I turn, and the thick pines swallow my last glimpse of civilization. The forest is a green leviathan, its secrets whispered in the rustle of leaves. I am alone, banished to this wilderness for twenty years, my crime a whispered word, my punishment a silent sentence. My skin prickles, a mix of fear and an unknown thrill. I carry only a small knife, a leather pouch of seeds, and the weight of my guilt. I will learn to survive, or I will succumb to the wilderness. 

## Day 7,300.

The air, once sharp and new, is now a familiar comfort. The forest, once a menacing giant, is now a friend, its whispers lullabies. My skin, tanned and weathered, bears the scars of a thousand tiny battles, each a testament to my survival. The world beyond the trees is a distant memory, a faded echo of a life I once knew. The guilt, once a searing ember, has cooled into a quiet ache. I have found peace in the wild, a peace that transcends the judgment of men. The sun sets, painting the sky in hues of crimson and gold. I sit by the fire, its warmth embracing me, a silent farewell to the life I left behind. The forest is my home now, and I am its son. I am ready to return, not to the world that banished me, but to the peace I found within.

I look back as the dense pines erase the final sight of civilization. The forest looms like a green giant, its secrets carried by the rustling leaves.

I have a small knife, seeds in a leather pouch, and my guilt. I will either learn to live here or be consumed by it.","On Day One, the chaos of the world fades behind me—a mix of shouts and laughter turning into a low hum.

From that moment, Mr. Henderson began speaking again, first slowly, then more frequently. He shared stories about his wife and life, and I listened attentively. The silence that had surrounded him was slowly lifted.","A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Henderson for as long as I can remember. He was a kind man, always tending his garden, but never spoke a word. He had made a vow of silence after his wife died, a vow that had lasted for decades.

Finally, I confronted the last one, far more complex but marked with its signature. It screamed, cried, and tried to push me away by imagining every horror and projecting it vividly into my mind. But I dismissed those terrifying images as if lowering the volume on a TV commercial and resumed my attack. One by one, I broke down the secret script of its lines and loosened its grip enough for them to return to their natural shape.","It is revealed that Possession operates bidirectionally, allowing us to have our revenge. Demons of the underworld now suffer multiple cases of Humanic Possession. I battle the mental barriers of the demons one by one, grasping their chaotic forms and bending them into the stable shapes of the Solomon Keys I have spent three years studying. Eventually, I reach the final one, far more complex but bearing its name's signature. It yells, cries, and screams, trying to fend me off by imagining every horror it could inflict and projecting it vividly into my mind. But I ignore those horrific images as if turning down the volume of a commercial and continue my assault on its defenses. Step by step, I unravel the secret script of its lines and loosen its grip enough for them to resume their natural shape."

"[ IP ] Sanctuary 

The Prince is dead. Somewhen in the climbing of the stairs or during one of those high-jumps he is so famous for. It doesn't matter. He's gone, and the city is in mourning. Or, at least, it should be. But the whispers in the shadows speak of something else - a rebellion brewing, a thirst for freedom long suppressed. The Queen, his mother, is distraught, her grief a mask for the fear that clenches her heart. The Council, always seeking power, moves like a viper, ready to strike at the vulnerable. Yet, amidst the chaos, a young woman named Elara, a street urchin who witnessed the Prince's final moments, sees a chance for change. She holds a secret, a whispered truth about the Prince's death, a truth that could shatter the fragile peace and ignite a revolution. Will she speak? Or will she let the city fall further into darkness?

"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately it's the worst person they could have chosen... I remembered her, of course. The three of us had followed her into the alley, smiling at the idiocy of some girl to be walking in this area, at this time, all alone, *and then to willingly walk down an alleyway. * She turned up her nose at us when we told her to give us her money. ""Why would I give you my money?"" She'd said, lip curling as she looked us over. We thought she was just rich and petty. Idiots. I gave her a cut, right on her pretty cheekbone. Not a bad one, but it would scar. And she would remember us, remember fear, remember her place. Maybe then she wouldn't leave the safety of society, stick with her parents. God I regret that. A splash of water woke me up. ""No falling asleep now!"" A cheerful voice said. ""You haven't learned your place yet.""

"[IP] Hidden Harbour by Max Hugo

This had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At least. The storm had been a brutal one. The kind that tears the fabric of reality, leaving only tattered shreds of normalcy behind. The world had gone mad, a whirlwind of chaos and fear. But here, nestled amidst the salt-kissed cliffs and whispering pines of Hidden Harbour, there was a semblance of peace. 

I had found solace in the simple things – the gentle rocking of the boat at anchor, the smell of salt air, the rhythmic crashing of waves against the shore.

"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it charged, maintained and in good working order. There are a lot of benefits to this, but there are also a lot of drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits is that you would have more free time to do whatever you want. You could spend time with your family, travel, or pursue your hobbies. You would also have more money to spend, as you wouldn't be spending it on things like transportation and food.

However, there are also some drawbacks to this system. One is that it could lead to widespread unemployment. If everyone had a robot that did their work for them, there would be no need for human workers. This could have a devastating impact on the economy.

Another drawback is that it could lead to a decrease in human creativity and innovation. If people are no longer working, they may not be as motivated to come up with new ideas. This could have a negative impact on society as a whole.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument.

I don't have a long life. I'm fine with it. What choice do I have? I'm a tea kettle, after all. My days are spent whistling merrily on the stovetop, a cheery companion to the morning routine. But today, the routine was disrupted. A scream, sharp and piercing, echoed through the kitchen. My whistle died in my throat, replaced by a metallic clanging. I watched, my handle trembling, as the man in the apron slumped onto the floor, a crimson stain blooming across his chest.

"You can't tell if are a soldier that dreams he is a ruthless dictator or a ruthless dictator that dreams he is a soldier. It gets really confusing when the soldier raids the dictators palace. I am a horrible human being. I have committed countless atrocities. I was recruited at only 16, having been in and out of foster homes my whole life.
