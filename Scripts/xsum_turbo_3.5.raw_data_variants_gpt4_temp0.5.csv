"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night session, sparking outrage among opposition parties and the public alike. The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup.

Critics argue that this bill is a brazen attempt by the ruling party to protect its own interests and maintain its hold on power. It is seen as a way to whitewash the crimes committed by politicians and their supporters during this tumultuous period.

The opposition argues that this amnesty undermines justice and accountability, sending the wrong message to the public that those in power are above the law. They believe that it is crucial for those responsible for any wrongdoing to be held accountable, regardless of their political affiliation.

Proponents of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to heal the deep divisions within society and move forward. They claim that the amnesty will help foster reconciliation and unity among the Thai people, allowing the nation to focus on the future rather than being shackled by the past.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a ""Growing Threat"", Researchers Say

The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.

According to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.

Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat.

"The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition groups have expressed skepticism and concerns over the effectiveness of this agreement.

The aim of these de-escalation zones is to reduce violence and create a safe environment for civilians in Syria. However, opposition groups fear that this deal could further divide the country and consolidate the power of President Bashar al-Assad.

"Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of fraud and money laundering following a lengthy investigation by the police.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been reduced by 25 basis points to stimulate economic growth and boost lending. The move by the central bank is aimed at providing relief to businesses and consumers amidst a slowdown in the economy.

The decision comes as the country grapples with trade tensions and weakening domestic demand. The central bank hopes that the rate cut will encourage borrowing and investment, ultimately supporting growth.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of £1.1m which it was awarding to a specific group of workers. The premium payment, known as the Additional Duties Allowance (ADA), was being given to support staff in the education sector, including caretakers, classroom assistants, and administrative staff.

The decision to remove the ADA has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that the funds can be better utilized elsewhere, such as improving educational resources or investing in teacher training. They believe that the ADA was an unnecessary expense that did not directly contribute to the quality of education.

However, critics argue that the removal of the premium payment will adversely affect the livelihoods of already underpaid and undervalued support staff. They argue that these workers, who play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth running of schools, deserve fair compensation for their additional duties.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace.

The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues.

Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society.

The survey findings have sparked calls for employers to reassess their policies and offer more extensive and flexible paternity leave options.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model.

S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain.

Davies believes that S4C should explore alternative funding models, such as partnerships with other broadcasters or introducing advertising, to ensure its long-term sustainability. He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms.

Unlike existing cycle hire schemes, these bikes have no docking stations and feature a locking rear brake so they can be left anywhere. Users access them through an app with GPS tracking. There is a one-time £49 refundable deposit and a 50p charge per half hour. More companies are expected to follow. oBike says it wants to work alongside existing schemes and has a social agenda to help clean London’s air and reduce emissions. It also seeks to collaborate with Transport for London and local councils, but this has not yet happened, causing some councils to be angry they weren’t consulted."

"The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year. A probation report three months earlier had highlighted concerns about Jetha's behavior, raising questions about whether proper action was taken to prevent this unfortunate incident.

According to the report, Jetha had a history of aggression and violent outbursts, particularly towards vulnerable individuals. Despite these red flags, it appears that appropriate measures were not taken to protect potential victims, and the consequences have been devastating.

The attack on the young child raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of the probation system and its ability to adequately assess and manage individuals with a propensity for violence.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that this initiative will alleviate the strain on primary care services and reduce the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in the country's defense policy. The move comes as Japan seeks to redefine its role on the global stage amidst growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.

Under the new legislation, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces will be able to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they can come to the aid of allies under attack. This marks a departure from Japan's long-standing pacifist stance, which restricted its military to defend its own territory only.

The passage of the legislation has been met with mixed reactions both domestically and internationally. Supporters argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in global security, given the changing regional dynamics and the rise of new threats. Critics, however, express concerns about potential constitutional implications and the possibility of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts.

"The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also strong, reflecting a positive trend in Scotland's job market. According to the report, this surge in placements was driven by increased business confidence and a gradual reopening of the economy.

The data revealed that permanent job placements in Scotland rose at the fastest rate since October 2018.

"Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it ""difficult to control his emotions and impulses."" Ben Butler, now infamous for the murder of his six-year-old daughter Elsa, had a history of violent outbursts that were consistently overlooked by the authorities.

Dr Tim Green's assessment of Butler's mental state, conducted nearly two decades ago, paints a disturbing picture of a man struggling to regulate his emotions. Green noted that Butler had a propensity for explosive anger, finding it hard to rein in his impulses.

Despite this early warning sign, Butler's violent tendencies were not effectively addressed or treated, allowing them to escalate over the years. Tragically, this untreated aggression culminated in the horrific murder of his own child, leaving a nation in shock and mourning.

Questions are now being raised about the adequacy of the mental health support system in identifying and intervening in cases like Butler's. The failure to adequately address his violent tendencies raises concerns about the potential dangers posed by individuals struggling with similar issues.

"Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley.

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands.

Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease.

By planting acorns, Forest Enterprise Scotland hopes to create a sustainable ecosystem that will foster the growth of oak trees and encourage the return of diverse wildlife. This initiative aligns with the Scottish government's commitment to increase woodland coverage and combat biodiversity loss.

"He threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid failed, and the Football Association turned it down in April. However, it seems that the controversial move may still be on the cards.

"The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be vigilant and proactive in managing their credit cards to avoid falling into financial distress.

The regulatory body's recent report highlighted that a significant number of credit card users were carrying high balances for extended periods, resulting in substantial interest charges. These customers were often stuck in a cycle of minimum repayments, which barely covered the interest, let alone made a dent in the principal amount.

The FCA emphasized the need for cardholders to regularly review their payments and consider alternative repayment strategies, such as paying more than the minimum amount due or consolidating balances onto lower-interest cards.

In addition, the authority called for greater transparency from credit card providers regarding the long-term costs of carrying high balances. It urged firms to provide clearer information on interest rates and repayment options to help customers make informed decisions.

"Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits to administering a harmful substance with intent to endanger life. The trial began yesterday at the Oxford Crown Court, where shocking details of the case were revealed.

Julia Knight, a 56-year-old nurse, stood accused of attempting to murder Irene Robson, an 81-year-old patient, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. In a surprising twist, Knight admitted to administering a harmful substance but firmly denied any intention to murder Robson.

The prosecution alleged that Knight had deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, leading to her deteriorating health and subsequent near-death experience. They argued that Knight had harbored a grudge against Robson, although the details surrounding this alleged motive remain unclear.

During the trial's opening statements, the defense acknowledged Knight's administration of the substance but emphasized that there was no intent to kill Robson. Instead, they claimed that Knight had made an error in judgment, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

"The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy.

The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change.

The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality.

If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure indicates that the UK's job market has remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit.

The ONS also revealed that the number of people in employment rose by 99,000 during the same period, reaching a record high of 32.7 million. This suggests that businesses are still hiring and expanding despite concerns about the country's future relationship with the European Union.

However, wage growth remains sluggish, with average weekly earnings increasing by only 3.2% excluding bonuses. This is below the rate of inflation, indicating that workers are not seeing much improvement in their purchasing power.

Experts have attributed the low unemployment rate to a combination of factors, including the rise of the gig economy and more people opting for self-employment. However, concerns remain about the quality of jobs being created, as many are part-time or offer low wages.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave.

"Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the fatal crash that claimed the lives of two young children. The incident occurred on the A34 motorway near Newbury, Berkshire, last Saturday.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing Maj Scott's car weaving in and out of traffic before losing control and colliding with another vehicle. The impact caused both cars to veer off the road and crash into a nearby tree.

Tragically, the two children, aged 3 and 5, who were passengers in the other vehicle, were pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of that car, a 32-year-old woman, sustained serious injuries and is currently in critical condition at a local hospital.

"The Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1) blasted off from the Naro Space Center at 16:00, marking a major milestone for South Korea's space program. This launch was the country's first successful attempt at putting a satellite into orbit using its own rocket.

"The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. The woman repeatedly reported Craig Hutsby, of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, for threatening behaviour and breach of bail conditions in July 2014. Despite her attempts to bring attention to his misconduct, the woman's pleas seemed to fall on deaf ears.

Hutsby's threatening behaviour and disregard for his bail conditions were a cause for concern within the community. The woman, terrified for her safety, contacted the local authorities on numerous occasions, detailing explicit incidents and providing evidence to support her claims.

This case highlights the need for a more robust and responsive approach to dealing with reports of threatening behaviour. It is essential that victims are taken seriously and that appropriate action is taken to address their concerns.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to maintain anonymity in their financial transactions. The investigation comes as US authorities crack down on money laundering and illicit financial activities.

Bearer bonds are financial instruments that grant ownership rights to whoever physically holds the bond. Because ownership is not registered, they have long been associated with illicit activities, such as tax evasion and money laundering. These bonds offer an attractive option for individuals seeking to move large sums of money discreetly across borders.

The Swiss bank, which has not been named, is being scrutinized for its potential involvement in the sale and handling of these bonds. US regulators are closely examining whether the bank facilitated the transfer of bearer bonds for clients, potentially aiding in illegal financial activities.

This investigation is part of a broader effort by US authorities to increase transparency in financial transactions and clamp down on unlawful practices.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub.

This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory.

Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats.

Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries.

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.

"The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing. The study highlighted concerns over the narrow focus of police officers, potentially leaving other vulnerable individuals at risk.

The research, which remains unpublished, analyzed the practices of three unidentified police forces in England and Wales. It found that officers were dedicating a significant amount of time and resources to cases involving violence, while other risk factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, and domestic disputes were receiving less attention.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea.

The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options.

The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods.

The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support.

"The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000. The closure of the facility came as a shock to the local community, which relied heavily on the abattoir for employment and the sourcing of locally produced meat.

Emcol 2008 Ltd had been struggling financially for some time, facing fierce competition from larger meat processing companies and an increasing demand for cheaper imported meat. Despite efforts to streamline operations and cut costs, the company was unable to recover from its mounting debt.

"Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died after being overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning on a boat trip in the Lake District in 2013. The court heard that Eteson had failed to properly maintain the vessel's exhaust system, leading to the tragic incident.

Prosecutors argued that the defendant's negligence and disregard for the safety of his passengers resulted in their untimely deaths. It was revealed that Eteson had attempted to repair the exhaust system himself, despite lacking the necessary expertise. This led to a fatal leak of carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas.

Witnesses recounted how Webster and Thornton had complained of feeling unwell during the boat trip, describing symptoms such as headaches and dizziness. Tragically, their conditions rapidly deteriorated, and both women died before they could receive medical attention.

"Spencer Flower claimed his involvement with a social housing company was not relevant to a debate in 2013 over the future of housing in east London. However, newly surfaced documents suggest otherwise. Flower, a prominent figure in the property development industry, vehemently denied any connection to the social housing sector during the heated discussion six years ago.

But recently obtained records reveal that Flower was, in fact, closely associated with a social housing company at the time. These documents shed light on his undisclosed role as a consultant for the company, raising questions about his credibility and transparency.

The debate in question centered around the rising need for affordable housing in the eastern part of the capital. Flower's attempt to distance himself from the social housing sector casts doubt on his motives and raises concerns about his integrity.

Critics argue that Flower's attempt to downplay his involvement with the social housing company undermines his credibility as a proponent for affordable housing solutions.

"That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, according to a report by the Institute for Economic Studies. The staggering figure highlights the immense wealth accumulated by the world's top billionaires.

The report analyzed the net worth of the world's wealthiest individuals and found that the top 1% now control an astounding $6 trillion, equivalent to the GDP of several major economies. This concentration of wealth raises concerns about income inequality and its implications for social and economic stability.

Critics argue that such vast accumulation of wealth exacerbates inequality and hampers social mobility. Income disparities have been a growing concern, with the COVID-19 pandemic further amplifying the divide. The report calls for policy interventions to address the issue, including progressive taxation and increased funding for social programs.

As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast. The decision by the Parades Commission has sparked controversy and reignited tensions between the Orange Order and the Catholic community.

Critics argue that the restriction is a clear demonstration of religious discrimination, as the parade route has historically included this section of the city. The Orange Order, however, claims that the decision is necessary to avoid potential clashes and maintain order.

Some Protestant groups are supportive, stating that it is a step towards maintaining peace and preventing further violence.

"The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The donations were allegedly given in exchange for political support of a controversial merger. Ms Choi has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Choi Gee-sung, a Samsung vice chairman, and Chang Choong-ki, a president at the group, were being interviewed on Monday by special prosecutors about the corruption allegations. It was reported the pair were being treated as witnesses, rather than being suspected of any wrongdoing. The claims circle around a merger between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries. The deal went through despite significant opposition from shareholders, who said it would hurt minority shareholders while benefiting the family of Samsung's group owner Lee Kun-hee. South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), which owns stakes in both companies, sealed the deal by voting in favour of it and the head of the NPS has since been arrested.

"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols, as the authorities strive to promote secularism and maintain social stability in the region.

The ban specifically targets clothing and symbols associated with Islam, such as the hijab and the crescent moon and star.

"Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his controversial bid for a third term, leading to widespread protests and subsequent crackdowns.

The arrested journalists, whose identities and nationalities were not disclosed, were taken into custody for allegedly breaching visa regulations and engaging in unauthorized activities. The police accused them of jeopardizing national security by reporting on armed groups operating in the country. The incident has raised concerns about press freedom and the government's commitment to transparency.

Burundi has a history of suppressing critical voices and curtailing media freedom. Human rights organizations have repeatedly condemned the government's actions, citing the high number of journalists and activists who have faced harassment, intimidation, or imprisonment.
