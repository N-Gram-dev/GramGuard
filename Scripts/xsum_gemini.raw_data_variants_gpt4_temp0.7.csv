"The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be invested in making more staff available to crew Fire Rescue Units. But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be ""dangerous and reckless"" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at stations with some specialist appliances.

"## Police Forces Under Scrutiny for Neglecting Non-Violent Crimes

Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are now being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for potential failings in their handling of non-violent crime, particularly cases related to domestic abuse. 

The IOPC investigation was triggered by a report from the College of Policing, which highlighted concerns about the prioritization of violent crime over other serious offenses. The report suggested that some police forces were neglecting non-violent crimes, potentially leading to a rise in repeat offenses and victims feeling unheard. The investigation aims to determine whether the identified police forces have adequately addressed these concerns and implemented appropriate measures to ensure effective crime prevention and victim support.

"## London's Red Buses Get a Makeover: Engine Removal Proposed for 142 Idle Vehicles

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal, which will be discussed at the next council meeting, could reach £1 million annually. The initiative, driven by the city's environmental and budgetary concerns, would see the repurposed buses used for static purposes, like advertising or mobile libraries. Critics argue the plan could negatively impact London's tourism industry, which relies on the iconic red buses. Proponents, however, believe the change is necessary to adapt to changing needs and prioritize sustainability. The decision will likely be a hotly contested one, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.

"## TfL Proposes New Driver Tests: Language, Navigation, and Landline Required

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a fixed landline telephone for all new driving licence applications. The proposed changes, aimed at enhancing road safety and driver competence, have sparked debate. 

The English language test would assess comprehension of road signs and traffic regulations, while the map-reading assessment aims to combat reliance on GPS navigation. The requirement for a fixed landline phone is intended to improve communication in emergencies, particularly in areas with limited mobile reception. 

The consultation period, open until [date], invites public feedback on the proposed changes and their potential impact on accessibility and affordability.

This news raises concerns about the future of the aerospace company and its impact on the local economy. 

The Welsh Government is currently evaluating its options for the hangar, which is a vital part of the St Athan Aerospace Enterprise Zone. Potential scenarios include re-tendering the lease, seeking a new tenant, or potentially even taking over the lease themselves.  

The committee heard that the Welsh Government is ""committed to supporting the aerospace industry"" in Wales and is actively working to ensure the continued success of the St Athan site. Further developments are expected in the coming weeks.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance. Uber said: ""If adopted these [rules] would mean an end to the Uber people know and love."" Black cab drivers have argued regulations need to be tightened. There has been growing pressure on city legislators, most recently when cab drivers protested outside City Hall. The Uber app connects customers and nearby drivers using GPS technology and gives an estimate of the fare. It generally charges lower fares than traditional firms and drivers rely on technology for navigation. Transactions are cashless using pre-registered bank details. TfL says the consultation seeks to ""raise standards across the industry"" following an ""exponential"" growth in the private hire industry and technology. Uber said it was a deliberate target and if the proposals went ahead they would raise prices and increase congestion in London. Gareth Mead, from Uber, said: ""If you think that this is supposed to be a public consultation, well I think the public are not at the heart of the proposals that have been made",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"## Thai Parliament Approves Controversial Amnesty Bill

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sparking protests and raising concerns about the potential for impunity. 

The bill, which aims to reconcile the country after years of political instability, covers a wide range of offences, including those related to the 2010 Red Shirt protests and the 2014 military coup. Critics argue that it would allow for the return of exiled politicians, including Mr Thaksin, and could shield those responsible for human rights abuses. 

Supporters, however, maintain that the amnesty is necessary to move the country forward and bring about national unity. The bill now faces a vote in the Senate, with its fate uncertain.

"## Sunak Accuses Doctors' Union of Spreading ""Misinformation"" 

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced criticism this morning for his handling of the ongoing dispute with the British Medical Association (BMA).  In a heated interview, Sunak accused the BMA of ""playing politics"" and refusing to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" about addressing the current NHS crisis.  He reiterated his offer of a 7% pay increase over the next two years, emphasizing it was the ""fairest and most sustainable"" solution.  However, the BMA insists that this offer falls short of the necessary 30% pay rise to address the years of real-terms pay cuts and the current staffing shortages plaguing the NHS.  The ongoing deadlock threatens further disruption to patient care, with the BMA planning further strikes in the coming months.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

"Erika Murray, 31, was arrested on Thursday night after a neighbour alerted police over the safety of other children living at the house. Detectives arrived at the residence in Blackstone, Massachusetts, and discovered a horrific scene. Three deceased infants were found inside the home, while a fourth child, believed to be approximately 13 years old, was discovered alive and in poor health.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave.

"The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the Welsh Government would be consulted on the matter, but there was no requirement for a referendum.  

The party has been accused of breaking its manifesto promise, with opposition parties calling for an immediate referendum. The party has defended its decision, saying that it is in the best interests of the Welsh people.

The funding floor is a controversial policy, with some arguing that it will help to protect public services in Wales. Others have argued that it will lead to a reduction in funding for vital services. 

The debate is likely to continue, with both sides of the argument making their case in the coming months.

"## Charity Aims to Resettle 480,000 Syrian Refugees by Year's End

The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. The ambitious goal, announced yesterday, aims to provide refuge for 480,000 Syrians currently living in precarious conditions in neighboring countries.

"## Injury Crisis Hits England Back Row Ahead of Crucial Test

England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Ito. The injuries come at a crucial time for the team, who are preparing for their upcoming Test matches.

"## Japan Approves Historic Legislation Allowing Troops to Fight Abroad

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the upper house, represents a significant shift in Japan's post-war security policy. It would allow the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they could fight alongside allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked.

The legislation has sparked controversy, with some arguing it will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts. Others, however, see it as a necessary step to bolster Japan's security in a rapidly changing regional landscape. The move comes amid growing tensions in the East China Sea, where Japan and China have overlapping territorial claims.

DUP MP Nigel Dodds called the commission's ruling a bureaucratic monstrosity.","Only the Orangemen and their 13 registered bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast, as happened last year, to the sound of a single drum beat. This year, all music must stop 43 meters from the church to ensure no music is audible nearby. A planned protest by residents has been limited to 50 people at two sites.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located near the city of Kagoshima, is known for its frequent eruptions, which have intensified in recent years. 

A new study published in the journal ""Nature"" reveals that the volcano's magma chamber is expanding, indicating a potential for larger and more destructive eruptions.

The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber.

"##  Thousands of Acorns Planted to Boost Forestry in Galloway

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant thousands of acorns around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 2,000 new oak trees, bolstering the region's vital forestry sector. This initiative aims to replenish native oak populations, vital for biodiversity and the local economy. 

The planting effort is part of a wider program focused on restoring ancient woodlands and promoting sustainable forestry practices. This initiative not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also offers economic opportunities through the creation of new woodlands and the potential for future timber harvests.

"## Google Assistant Expands Beyond Pixel Phones, Now Available on Samsung Galaxy Devices

Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their device using voice commands, making tasks like setting alarms, sending messages, and controlling smart home devices effortless. But in a significant move, Google has announced the expansion of Assistant's reach, making it available on Samsung Galaxy devices starting today. 

This move marks a major shift in the voice assistant landscape, opening up a whole new market for Google Assistant. With Samsung's strong foothold in the Android market, the partnership promises to make Assistant accessible to a wider range of users.

"##  Rwenzururu King's Medical Privileges Sparks Controversy 

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But the decision to grant him access to a private hospital for treatment has sparked controversy. Critics argue that Mumbere, who is facing charges of treason and murder, should be treated in a public hospital like any other prisoner.

"The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be ""a retrograde step"" and could ""damage the UK's reputation as a welcoming destination for international students."" 

The proposed changes are part of a wider package of measures aimed at tightening immigration controls. The government argues that the stricter requirements are necessary to ensure that only those with a genuine intention to study in the UK are granted visas. However, critics argue that the changes could deter talented students from applying to UK universities.

The impact of these changes on international student numbers remains to be seen. Some experts believe that the stricter requirements could lead to a decline in applications, while others argue that the UK's universities will remain attractive to students from around the world.

"She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1972.  The event was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the shootings, which remain a source of controversy and pain for the community.  The four men, who were all unarmed, were shot dead by soldiers who claimed they were carrying weapons.  However, no weapons were ever found at the scene.  The victims were identified as John McKerr, Brian Friel, Charles McElvogue and Eugene Kelly.  Their families have been campaigning for justice for decades, and the event on Thursday was a chance for them to remember their loved ones and to call for a full and independent inquiry into the shootings.

The families of the men were joined by local politicians and community leaders at the event.  They heard speeches from speakers who called for an end to the cycle of violence and for a more peaceful future.  The event was also a reminder of the ongoing pain and suffering caused by the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

"## Newsweek Goes Digital: Print Edition to End After 85 Years

The last print edition of Newsweek will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with The Daily Beast in 2010, and the combined entity will continue to publish online and in mobile formats.

“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, which owns The Daily Beast. “The print advertising market is simply not sustainable for a weekly news magazine.” 

The move marks the end of an era for the iconic magazine, which was founded in 1933 and has won numerous awards for its journalism. However, Newsweek's online presence has grown significantly in recent years, with a strong following on social media. The company hopes to reach a wider audience by focusing on digital platforms.

"## Climate Change Costs Could Top $178 Trillion by 2100, New Report Warns

That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) revealed. The report, titled ""The Economic Impacts of Climate Change,"" paints a stark picture of the potential economic devastation wrought by climate change if immediate and drastic action isn't taken. 

The IEP analysis predicts that global GDP could decline by 7.2% by 2100, primarily due to decreased productivity and increased costs associated with extreme weather events. The report urges governments and businesses to prioritize green investments and implement robust climate change adaptation strategies to mitigate these devastating consequences.

"## Historic Lyndhurst Park Hotel Facing Demolition for Luxury Flats

The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling and visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson, is facing demolition. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a luxury retirement village, sparking outrage from heritage campaigners. 

The hotel, built in the 18th century, sits in a picturesque location near Lymington, Hampshire. It has been a popular destination for centuries, attracting notable figures such as Stevenson, who stayed there in the 1880s. However, the building has fallen into disrepair and has been empty for several years.

PegasusLife argues that the development will ""provide much-needed housing for the elderly"" and create jobs. However, heritage groups have condemned the plans, calling the hotel ""a vital part of local history"" and urging for its preservation. A public consultation is underway, and the fate of the Lyndhurst Park Hotel remains uncertain.
