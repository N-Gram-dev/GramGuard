"Question: Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation syndrome? 
Answer: In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the anterior chamber depth was significantly shallower in the affected eye compared to the unaffected eye, regardless of head position. This suggests that pseudoexfoliation itself, rather than head positioning, contributes to anterior chamber depth discrepancies. 
",ai,"Does the position of the head affect the anterior chamber depth in cases of pseudoexfoliation syndrome? In patients with clearly diagnosed unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the anterior chamber depth was notably shallower in the affected eye than in the unaffected eye, independent of head position.
