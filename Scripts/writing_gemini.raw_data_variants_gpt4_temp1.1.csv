"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). The question specifically deals with writing as a female (which may or may not apply to you) but the answer is universal, as evidenced by this particular quote: > Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included. Coal mining is",human,"How should I begin? As Lewis Carroll famously said, ""Start at the beginning, keep going until you reach the end, and then stop."" Writing seems less daunting once you uncover the secret: becoming a skilled writer requires first producing a lot of bad writing. Don’t hesitate or overthink—just write. Don’t stress about your work being poor; that’s a good sign because it helps you clear out the bad writing so better writing can emerge. Not everyone becomes a good writer, but no one improves without first writing badly. To conclude, I recommend reading the 48th Dear Sugar column titled *Write Like A Motherfucker*. Though it addresses female writers, its wisdom is universal, captured in the quote: Writing is difficult for everyone, including straight white men. Coal mining is...","Where to start? Borrowing from Lewis Carroll: ""Begin at the beginning, and proceed until you reach the end; then stop."" Writing loses its fear once you understand the crucial truth: good writers emerge after they’ve pushed through heaps of bad writing. Stop thinking, simply write. Do not worry that your work might be terrible—that’s essential for clearing out inferior drafts so that quality writing can come. Although not all become good writers, everyone who is good has first created some lousy work. Finally, I suggest reading Dear Sugar’s 48th column, *Write Like A Motherfucker*, addressing writing from a female perspective but offering advice for all; as it states, Writing is challenging for all, including straight white men. Coal mining is...","How do you begin? Lewis Carroll’s advice fits perfectly: ""Start at the beginning and continue until you reach the end; then stop.""

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Let's create a universe that's younger and gentler, with much more mass. Imagine the space between planets filled with breathable air at safe pressures. The sun's heat reduces this atmosphere to near-vacuum near its surface and turns it into plasma nearby. Charged gases get pushed away through the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases in along the equatorial plane, creating convection currents. These currents vary due to the sun’s changing magnetic field and may involve multiple flows simultaneously. This combined heat transfer makes zones near the sun extremely hot, but also widens the habitable zone. Here, solar winds literally feel like wind and should not be underestimated.","Let's imagine a much younger, less violently formed universe possessing significantly greater mass. The spaces between worlds contain breathable air at life-supporting pressure. The sun’s heat thins this atmosphere to almost vacuum near its surface and ionizes it into plasma beyond. Hot, charged gases flow outward along the sun's magnetic poles, while cooler gases flow inward along the plane perpendicular to those poles, creating a convection cycle. Due to the sun’s fluctuating magnetic field, this convection is unpredictable and sometimes simultaneous multiple currents arise. This large-scale heat movement causes areas close to the sun to be extremely hot, yet greatly expands the habitable zone. Solar winds in this environment function as real winds—substantial and tangible.","Picture a younger universe without violent origins, containing much more mass. In the void between planets, breathable air exists at survivable pressure levels. The sun warms this air, diluting it to a near vacuum by the surface and transforming it to plasma further away. Hot charged gases are expelled along the magnetic poles of the sun, pulling cooler gases inward at a 90-degree angle to those poles, thus setting up convection currents. The sun’s magnetic field varies, making the currents unpredictable and possibly forming numerous simultaneous flows. This results in an effective heat transfer: while near the sun it’s extreme heat, the habitable zone becomes vast, and solar winds truly become winds.","Consider a much younger universe formed less violently and with substantially more mass. The space separating worlds is filled with breathable air under pressure conducive to life. Heat from the sun causes the atmospheric density to decrease to near-vacuum at its surface and heats it into plasma nearby. Heated, charged gases rush out along the sun’s magnetic poles, which in turn draws cooler gases inward along a plane perpendicular to these poles, forming a convection process. The sun’s shifting magnetic field leads to unpredictable, often simultaneous multiple convection currents. This cumulative heat transfer means intense heat near the sun but creates an extensive habitable zone. Solar winds effectively function as genuine winds here.","Let's consider a more youthful, less violently created cosmos with significantly increased mass. The spaces between its worlds contain breathable air at survivable pressures. Sunlight reduces this air density to near vacuum close to the sun’s surface and energizes it into plasma at further distances. Hot, charged gases are ejected via the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward along planes perpendicular to those poles, thus establishing convection currents. The unpredictable nature of the sun's magnetic field allows multiple convection currents to happen simultaneously. The consequent heat distribution causes near-solar regions to be as hot as an oven, but enlarges the habitable zone significantly. Under these conditions, solar wind manifests truly as wind.","Imagine a universe young in age, less violently formed, and containing a vastly greater amount of mass. Void space between worlds is filled with breathable air maintained at pressures suitable for life. Heat from the sun thins this atmosphere toward a vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at closer ranges. Charged hot gases flow outward along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases along a plane 90 degrees offset, establishing convection currents. The sun's magnetic field varies, making these currents unpredictable and often multiple in nature. This complex heat transfer implies that while regions near the sun are scorching, the habitable zone is exceptionally wide, with solar winds that actually act like real winds.","Imagine a nascent, less violent universe with much more mass. Interplanetary space is filled with breathable air at life-sustaining pressure. Sun’s heat thins this air to nearly vacuum near its surface and ionizes it into plasma further away. Charged particles are propelled outward through the sun’s magnetic poles, leading to an influx of cooler gas along the perpendicular plane—this creates convection currents that are dynamic and often multiple at the same time due to the sun's variable magnetic field. This heat transport results in extremely hot sun-proximate zones but vastly expands the habitable areas. This setting turns solar winds into literal winds.","Envision a younger universe, less violently birthed, containing substantially more mass. The void between celestial bodies is filled with breathable air under survivable pressure. The sun’s heat reduces that air to near vacuum at its surface and converts it into plasma at greater proximity. Hot, charged gases are expelled toward the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward at a 90-degree angle, generating convection currents. Variability in the sun’s magnetic field causes these currents to be unpredictable and often multi-layered. The heat transferred this way makes nearby solar regions extremely hot but greatly expands habitable zones, rendering solar winds a tangible breeze.","Visualize a younger cosmos, less violently established, with significantly increased mass. Breaths are possible in the space between worlds because it’s filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this atmosphere near its surface to almost vacuum levels and energizes it to plasma at closer range. Hot charged gases are forced away along the sun’s magnetic poles, which causes cooler gases to flow inward along the perpendicular plane, creating convection currents that shift regularly due to magnetic field variations, sometimes resulting in multiple currents running together. The net heat transfer yields oven-like conditions near the sun but also greatly enlarges the habitable zone. Here, solar winds are genuinely wind—real and palpable.","Think of a younger, less violently formed universe with a vastly greater mass. The vacuum between planets contains breathable air at survivable pressure. Sun heat reduces density toward near vacuum at the sun’s surface and heats the atmosphere into plasma in proximate space. Charged gases are pushed outward along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases perpendicular to those poles in a convection cycle. The sun’s magnetic field, ever-changing, causes this cycle to be unpredictable and sometimes multiple simultaneously. This results in extraordinary heat near the sun but vastly expands the habitable zone, making solar winds literal wind indeed."

Holding the doll close, tears blur its chipped smile as you whisper, ""I understand.""","Within one year of birth, parents typically receive a small gift or note from their future 18-year-old child via time travel.

""I didn't do anything,"" the teen whispered, his voice trembling. The soldier took a step closer, his boots crunching on broken glass.  ""You know the rules. Anyone outside curfew is a rebel."" He raised his rifle, the glint of the barrel catching the dying light of the setting sun. The teen closed his eyes, bracing for the worst.

There was something chilling about a boy alone in his room, battling his nighttime demons. *Monsters aren't real,* Tim reassured, pulling the covers over his face. *If they existed, my parents would have taught me how to run away.* Feeling slightly better, he lowered the covers to his chin and looked again at his closet. The door was now open wider.","I'm almost positive I have closed my closet door more times than I've opened it... Tim fixed his eyes on the hole on the opposite side of the room; he remembered closing the closet door this morning. Peering into the black crevice between pine and an endless darkness that shifted into colors behind his shut eyes. Despite overcoming many fears at age 12, this was something different and terrifying. A boy on his own in his room, battling the night's demons was bone-chilling. *Monsters don't exist,* Tim told himself, pulling the covers over his face. *If they did, my mom and dad would've taught me to escape.* Calmer now, he shifted the covers to under his chin and glanced toward the closet. The door was now ajar wider than before.","I’m quite sure I’ve closed the closet door more than I’ve opened it... Tim focused on the hole across his room, knowing he had closed that door earlier that morning. Looking into the dark slit between pine wood and infinite blackness, which turned to swirling colors when he closed his eyes. Tim, a 12-year-old who had conquered many challenges, felt an eerie dread at this. The thought of a boy, alone in his room, facing night demons was terrifying. *Monsters aren’t real,* he told himself as he pulled the covers over his face. *If they did exist, my parents would have shown me how to escape.* Comforted, he lowered the covers to his chin and looked back at the closet. The door had opened wider.","I’m fairly convinced I’ve shut my closet door more times than I’ve opened it... Tim intently stared at the hole on the other side of the room, certain he closed it that morning. Staring into the black crevice between the pine door and endless darkness that ethereally flickered into colors when his eyes were shut. Although only 12, Tim had overcome many fears but none as chilling as this—being alone in his room fighting nightly demons. *Monsters aren’t real,* Tim whispered, pulling covers over his face. *If monsters were real, my parents would’ve told me how to run away.* Reassured, he lowered the covers to his chin and looked again. His closet door was open wider now.","I’m pretty sure I closed my closet door more times than I opened it... Tim stared intently at the closet hole from across the room, remembering he shut it this morning. He peered into the dark crevice between the pine wood and endless void that shifted into swirling colors behind closed eyelids. At only twelve years old, he’d confronted many fears, but nothing as terrifying as this. A boy, alone, facing nighttime demons in his room was chilling. *There's no such thing as monsters,* Tim thought as he pulled the covers over his face. *If monsters were real, Mom and Dad would’ve taught me how to run.* Feeling safer, he lowered the covers to his chin and looked back. The closet door was now open wider.","I'm almost sure I've shut the closet door more times than I've opened it... Tim gazed intently at the hole across the room, convinced he shut it this morning.

The closet door had opened wider.","I'm quite sure I've shut my closet door more times than I've opened it... Tim looked intently at the hole opposite him, remembering closing the closet that morning. Looking into the dark crack between the pine door and an endless abyss that shifted into dancing hues when he closed his eyes. Being twelve, Tim had gotten past many fears but none this profoundly chilling: a boy alone in his room fighting off nighttime demons. *Of course monsters aren’t real,* he told himself, pulling covers over his face. *If they were, Mom and Dad would have told me how to escape.* With reassurance, he lowered his covers and glanced once more at the closet. The door was open wider now.","I'm fairly certain I've shut the closet door more times than I have opened it before... Tim focused on the hole on the far side of his room, certain he closed it this morning. Gazing into the black gap between pine and infinite darkness that transformed into rippling colors with closed eyes. At just 12 years old, Tim had faced numerous fears, but none so terrifying as this—being alone, a boy threatened by nighttime demons. *No monsters exist,* he reassured, drawing covers over his face. *If they did, my parents would have taught me how to run away.* Settled, he lowered his covers and turned toward the closet. It was now open wider.","I'm pretty sure I've closed my closet door more than I've opened it... Tim stared at the hole on the other side of the room, remembering he closed it that morning. Into the dark gap between pine wood and endless night, shifting to dancing colors when eyes closed.

Though dubbed evil by foes for prioritizing efficiency over honor, he was a wise ruler who freed many serfs. His larger army eliminated bandits either by recruiting or execution. Roads improved via army patrols and repairs. An attempted uprising led by a hero failed, with peasants dying; victories by such heroes would mean higher taxes and regressive social policies.

"## A Man, a Wilderness, and Two Diary Entries

**Day 1**

I. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The sun bleeds through the canopy, casting the forest floor in a tapestry of light and shadow. I stand at the edge of the wilderness, the boundary between civilization and exile.  A cold wind whips through the trees, carrying with it the whispers of my shame.  Twenty years.  Twenty years to atone for my crime, to live amongst the creatures that fear me more than the men I wronged. The wilderness is a harsh mistress, but I must embrace her embrace, for she is my only sanctuary now.

**Day 7300**

I. The sun sets on the horizon, painting the sky with fiery hues of orange and crimson. The air is still, filled with the gentle chirping of crickets. I sit on a moss-covered rock, a weathered journal in my lap. My fingers, gnarled and calloused, trace the words I have written over the years. A lifetime in this wilderness.  My exile is almost over, and the world outside, once familiar, now seems alien.  I have become one with the forest, a creature of the wild.  But will I be welcomed back to the world of men? Or am I destined to forever be a prisoner of my past, even as I am freed from this prison of nature?

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020. It was a nice neo-Victorian in the middle of the city. A bit overpriced, but the location was perfect.

Sometimes it's the maniacal cackling at odd hours into the night, sometimes it's little contained explosions in his back yard, and sometimes it's his.... company that he keeps, but in spite of all the annoying idiosyncrasies, he's actually a good neighbor. It certainly is interesting being his neighbor, but for the few faults I can find, I can name several good things about him. For starters, he runs the neighborhood watch. Correction, he is the neighborhood watch. Him and his armada of drones, constantly watching the neighborhood. He never asks to be compensated, and when offered he would usually say something to the effect of ""Would run surveillance anyway, might as well help out.""

"## A Creation Myth: The Dance of Light and Shadow

Long ago, before the world was, there lived only a being of pure light. This being, shimmering and radiant, yearned for companionship, for something to share its brilliance with.  But in its solitude, the light grew afraid of its own immensity. It yearned for a counterpoint, a balance. 

One day, the light, in its infinite desire, decided to divide itself. It split into two – one remaining pure and radiant, the other becoming the opposite: cold, dark, and still.  The light, now known as the sun, danced across the void, painting the darkness with its brilliance.  But the darkness, known as the moon, held its own, refusing to be consumed.  And so, the dance began. 

Day after day, the sun chased the moon across the sky, painting the world in vibrant hues and then retreating, allowing the moon to bathe it in its cool, silver light. This eternal chase, this constant interplay of light and dark, became the rhythm of the world, the very essence of life.  And so, the sun and moon, forever intertwined, became the source of the day and night, the creators of the world as we know it.

Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done.

"Two people discover a fountain of youth. The problem is that upon drinking the water, you turn back into an infant. The two decide to take turns raising each other, ensuring a continuous cycle of youth.  

Elias, a weary, aging professor, stumbled upon the fountain while researching ancient myths. He shared his discovery with Amelia, a young woman who had always felt trapped by her fleeting youth. They agreed on a plan: Elias would drink first, becoming an infant, while Amelia cared for him. When he reached adulthood, he would tend to Amelia while she experienced her second childhood. 

Their lives became a perpetual loop of infancy and maturity, punctuated by the joyous chaos of diaper changes and the bittersweet melancholy of forgotten memories.

"An angel has now been exiled from both Heaven and Hell. Apparently causing one little tiny apocalypse is enough to get one fired in that town, and not.  They’d have had more sympathy if she’d managed to level a city, apparently. Not that she was sorry. In fact, she felt quite pleased with herself.  After all, she’d merely rearranged a couple of planetary alignments, creating a minor solar flare that had fried a few communication satellites. It wasn't her fault if the resulting power outage had caused the entire global economy to grind to a halt. She was merely fulfilling her destiny, as a bringer of chaos.  

Now, she was stranded on Earth, a planet of mud and grass and creatures that ate each other.  It was a far cry from the celestial landscapes she was accustomed to, but she supposed it had a certain charm.  There were, for instance, a great many humans. And they were all so completely oblivious to their own absurdity. That’s what she enjoyed most about them.  Their ignorance was a kind of bliss.  She figured she could stay here a while.

People scatter, leaving their congested cars behind on the freeway to run faster on foot. Despair and pandemonium ensue. Just like a classic monster movie scene: Godzilla, King of Monsters, has come to claim his throne. ""With a name like mine, you'd expect I could just doodle around in the air,"" Da Mangaka says from the rooftop edge, using third person narrative for dramatic effect. ""Although I can't tap into Heaven's Door, Exogenesis is an option."" ""I'm surprised you haven't watched the series,"" someone says."

"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately, it's the worst person they could have chosen…

I remembered her, of course. The way her eyes, usually bright and lively, had hardened into something cold and calculating. The faint scent of ozone that clung to her like a second skin. The way she moved, with a fluid grace that belied the raw power she held within. 

She turned, her gaze sweeping over the four of them, and a low chuckle escaped her lips. It wasn't a friendly sound, more like a wind whipping through a graveyard. 

“Well, well,” she said, her voice a silky whisper that held a dangerous edge. “Look what the tide has washed in. I was wondering when you lot would show up.”

"## A Man in the Wilderness

**Day 1:**

The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and fear. I'm alone, banished to this forsaken wilderness, my life stripped bare, my future an empty canvas. The forest whispers secrets I don't understand, and the shadows seem to hold judgment. I built a meager shelter, a flimsy shield against the unknown. A single tear rolls down my cheek, leaving a salty trace on my skin. Twenty years. I can barely fathom the immensity of that time.

**Day 7,300:**

The sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and fading purple. This final sunset is different. I don't feel fear, only a quiet acceptance. The wilderness has been my teacher, my tormentor, my solace. I have learned to survive, to endure, to find beauty in the stark simplicity of life.  The forest, once a prison, now feels like home. It's time to return. I am not the same man who walked in all those years ago. I am stronger, wiser, more at peace.  And I carry the wilderness with me, forever etched into the landscape of my soul. 
",ai,"A man left alone in the wild faces the heavy scent of pine and fear on the first day, with a bare life and uncertain future, as the forest murmurs mysteries and shadows judge, his fragile shelter barely shielding him, a tear marking twenty long years of endurance.","On the first day, the exile breathes in the thick pine air and fear, isolated in desolation, life emptied out and future blank, while the forest softly speaks unknown secrets and shadows hold condemnation, shelter fragile, tear salty, reflecting two decades of struggle.","Day one in the wilderness: thick pine scent mingling with fear, alone and forsaken, life stripped away, future undefined, the forest’s cryptic whispers daunting, shadows seem condemning, a weak shelter offers modest defense, a tear traces twenty years of isolation.","Bitter fear and pine fragrance fill the air on day one, abandoned in an empty wilderness, life and prospects erased, enigmatic forest whispers and judging shadows haunting, a fragile refuge built, a lone tear signaling the weight of twenty years.","Alone, exiled into a wilderness suffused with the scent of pine and fear on day one, left with an empty life and future, the forest murmurs unfathomable secrets, shadows seem to judge, a meager shelter stands weak, and a single tear marks twenty years’ depth.","On the opening day, the scent of pine blends with dread as I stand alone in a wild despair, my existence bare, future blank, forest whispers secrets I cannot decode, shadows hold judgment, my feeble shelter barely protective, tear salty from twenty years endured.","At the start, thick pine air and fear fill my lungs as I am sent away into a wild wasteland; life and future barren, the forest murmur perplexing secrets, shadows seemingly judge, shelter fragile, a single tear commemorates two decades alone.","Firstly, the wilderness envelops me in a mix of pine aroma and fear; abandoned, my life bereft and future empty, forest secrets I cannot grasp, shadows judging, shelter scant, a tear slides down my cheek, twenty years rolled into one moment.","The wilderness greets me on day one with sharp pine scents and fear's weight; isolated, my life bare, future blank, forest whispers mysteries beyond me, shadows bearing judgment, my shelter a fragile barrier, a tear falling, symbolizing twenty long years.","On day one in the wilderness, I breathe in dense pine and fear, fully alone and cast away, life and prospects stripped, the forest’s whispers cryptic, shadows seeming judgmental, a makeshift shelter crafted, a single tear reflecting the expanse of twenty years."

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end."" 

It's a deceptively simple concept, yet the beginning can be the most daunting part of writing a story. Fear not, fellow storytellers! The secret lies in your imagination. Let a single image, a whispered phrase, or a fleeting thought ignite your creative spark. It could be a flickering candle in a dusty attic, the scent of cinnamon on a chilly night, or the rustle of leaves in a silent forest.

Once you have your seed, let it grow. Explore the world it suggests, delve into the emotions it evokes, and let the characters unfold before you. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. So, begin at the beginning, let your pen dance, and let the magic of storytelling weave its spell.

"You discover that Earth is the ""North Korea"" of the galaxy. It happened by fluke when a Czarnian turned up looking to make a documentary on the ""most isolated, secretive, and technologically backward planet in the known universe.""

What he got was a bustling, technologically advanced planet with a global network and a thriving social media scene.  

""You have… internet?"" Zorp asked, his three eyes wide with disbelief as you explained the concept of the internet, social media, and the various streaming services available. You explained that Earth was a democracy, with free speech and a vibrant political scene. He laughed, a raucous, throaty sound, ""Democracy? What is this, a joke?"" 

It turned out Earth, despite its advanced technology and global interconnectedness, was considered a pariah in the galactic community. The reason? Our tendency to hoard information and technology, our fear of contact with the ""unknown,"" and our general paranoia about extraterrestrial life. Zorp's film crew left with their tails between their legs, muttering about the ""unfathomable absurdity"" of the human race.

"## Build a World Part I: Inception

Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no stars, only vast, swirling nebulae? Imagine a universe where the very fabric of space is alive, pulsing with a gentle, luminescent energy. This energy coalesces into swirling clouds of gas and dust, each one unique and constantly changing. Instead of planets, there are vast, organic islands of land, floating on currents of the nebulae. Life, in this universe, takes the form of bioluminescent creatures, their bodies shimmering and pulsing like the nebulae themselves. They are interconnected, their minds forming a vast, shared consciousness, communicating through the subtle shifting patterns of their light. 

Perhaps the first sentient beings in this universe wouldn't be individual creatures, but rather these interconnected clouds, whispering their secrets through the swirling patterns of light.

Alright, let me begin. Imagine a far younger and less violent universe that contains no stars, only immense, swirling nebulae. Picture a cosmos where space itself is alive, softly glowing with a luminous energy. This energy forms into dynamic, swirling clouds of gas and dust, each distinct and ever-changing. Instead of traditional planets, massive organic landmasses float amid the nebula currents. Life here consists of bioluminescent beings whose bodies pulse and shimmer like the nebulae surrounding them. Their minds connect to create a vast shared consciousness, communicating by shifting patterns of light.

Maybe the very first sentients are not solitary beings but these interconnected clouds, conveying secrets through their glowing, swirling forms.","## Build a World Part I: Inception

The world shrieks behind me, a cacophony of shouts and laughter, now fading to a distant hum. I turn, and the thick pines swallow my last glimpse of civilization. The forest is a green leviathan, its secrets whispered in the rustle of leaves. I am alone, banished to this wilderness for twenty years, my crime a whispered word, my punishment a silent sentence.

You’d rather curl up on your pile of gold than give heed to these noisy challengers. Moreover, the only treasure you truly prize is the wealth of knowledge accumulated over centuries—the history of the world, magic’s secrets, and the best pastry recipes—all of which no hero can ever take away."

"""All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!"" ``.... through the gate!"" That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place. Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time. ""All is lost!"" he screamed. ""The enemy is through the gate!""

Instead, I was sent alone—a narcoleptic sentry—tasked with watching for any approaching attacks.

If it were my choice, I wouldn’t have been placed there at all. At the very least, they might have partnered me with another guard.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was grieving, her face remained resolutely blank.

Observing my colleagues scanning the Disc repeatedly, all efforts reveal nothing new. Leading experts decided mathematics would be the optimal way to communicate with alien races due to the complexity of our language for outsiders to comprehend unaided. The initial scans determined the object’s physical characteristics—hundreds of rings with multiple grooves in each. Initially, we thought something was designed to be passed through these rings as a kind of bit, but the full physical structure appeared nonsensical.

Once again, I watch my colleagues analyze the Disc, once again discovering nothing. Our foremost scholars concluded math to be the only effective communicative tool with alien civilizations, considering human language is too complicated without assistance. Early scans revealed hundreds of rings and even more grooves per ring on the Disc. We initially speculated an object resembling a bit was to be inserted through these rings, but the overall physical design defied explanation.

I watch as my colleagues carry out repeated scans of the Disc, uncovering nothing new. Our best minds decided that math was likely the best universal language to communicate with spacefaring aliens since our language’s complexity makes it too difficult otherwise. Initial scans revealed the physical aspects of the Disc—hundreds of rings with multiple grooves in each ring. We first considered an object—a kind of bit—might go through the rings, but once we saw the full structure it made no sense.

Early scanning unlocked the physical parameters of the Disc—hundreds of rings with countless grooves.

"After a world-wide cataclysm, you're the only human left alive. In your extreme loneliness, you've created an imaginary friend who follows you.

There are other, busier ports I sometimes visit.","Max Hugo describes Hidden Harbour as a long-standing safe refuge—which I hope it always remains—my permanent home unless at sea. Am I a pirate? Maybe, but reclaiming what’s mine isn’t theft. It’s a children’s tale: a prince exiled under threat of death; no happy ending yet, though. The Consul would call me thief, crook, and murderer—but that lying, regicide son of a king would say so. Taking an Imperial galleon when out of funds doesn't seem so bad, does it?

"A voice in the sky will tell you when you've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to the bustling city, a familiar ache settling in your chest. You know you'll be back, but there's a certain finality to this departure. 

The city unfolds before you, a labyrinth of concrete and steel. You walk the same streets, past the same cafes and shops, but everything feels different. The air hums with a quiet energy, a premonition of change. A voice whispers in your ear, faint but persistent: ""This is the last time you'll see this."" You try to ignore it, to cling to the familiarity, but it's there, a constant shadow. 

You linger in a park, watching children chase pigeons, their laughter echoing through the twilight.  As the sun sets, casting long shadows across the cityscape, the voice returns, louder this time,  ""This is the last time you'll see this.""  You know it's true, and a bittersweet wave of acceptance washes over you.

This had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At least. The storm had been a brutal one. The kind that tears the fabric of reality, leaving only tattered shreds of normalcy behind. The world had gone mad, a whirlwind of chaos and fear. But here, nestled amidst the salt-kissed cliffs and whispering pines of Hidden Harbour, there was a semblance of peace.

It displayed a blurry image – a smuggler, face obscured, holding a datapad that displayed a picture of a Trandosian with a big, green grin.  The bounty hunter, it seemed, had gone off the grid. And he was carrying a very expensive piece of intel.  “Looks like we got a job, kid.” Han said, a wicked glint in his eye.  “And this time, it ain’t gonna be pretty.”

"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it charged, maintained and in good working order. There are a lot of benefits to this, but there are also a lot of drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits is that you would have more free time to do whatever you want. You could spend time with your family, travel, or pursue your hobbies. You would also have more money to spend, as you wouldn't be spending it on things like transportation and food.

However, there are also some drawbacks to this system. One is that it could lead to widespread unemployment. If everyone had a robot that did their work for them, there would be no need for human workers. This could have a devastating impact on the economy.

Another drawback is that it could lead to a decrease in human creativity and innovation. If people are no longer working, they may not be as motivated to come up with new ideas. This could have a negative impact on society as a whole.
",ai,"No person would ever need to work again; instead, a robot would go to work and earn a salary on their behalf, though they would be responsible for charging, maintaining, and ensuring it functions properly. This has many advantages but also notable disadvantages.","Humans wouldn't need to labor anymore because robots would handle the work and generate income for them, while they'd have the duty to keep these robots charged and well-maintained. This system offers numerous benefits along with significant drawbacks.","Work would become obsolete for humans when robots perform jobs and earn paychecks, with owners only needing to keep their machines charged and in good condition. There are plenty of perks, yet also plenty of downsides to this arrangement.","People no longer have to work themselves as robots would take over their jobs and receive wages for them; however, owners must ensure these robots remain charged and properly maintained. This setup provides many positive outcomes but also some negative ones.","Humans can avoid working entirely by relying on robots that earn money through their labor, provided the owners keep the robots charged and in working order. This concept presents many benefits but also serious challenges.","No human ever needs to work again because a robot accomplishes their job and makes their earnings, but it is their responsibility to maintain, charge, and care for the robot. This idea has numerous advantages as well as disadvantages.","With robots working on behalf of people and earning their wages, no person needs to labor anymore, though they have to maintain, charge, and ensure robot functionality. This notion carries several benefits along with some drawbacks.","The necessity for humans to work would vanish as robots complete their tasks and earn income, though it falls on humans to keep these robots charged and well-maintained. This model offers multiple benefits but also notable drawbacks.","Humans would never need to work again, having robots earn their pay while they are responsible for charging, servicing, and upkeep. This approach includes many advantages but equally many disadvantages.","People would be relieved from working since robots would do the work and get paid for them, but owners must keep the robots charged and in good shape. There are considerable benefits to this, though there are also some drawbacks."

Sheathing his Holy blade, he turned his back on the wounded being on the stones. Resuming his nomadic path, he contemplated the history. Once, gods and men shared peaceful existence—humans offering worship and sacrifice, gods bestowing blessings and protection. But that was before the Rift. A thousand years past, the Great Divide threw the world into chaos. Some divine entities hoped to grant humans godlike power, inspired by their loyalty and possession of an unknown power to gods: LOVE. The higher beings rejected this notion, fearing that human capacity for war and revenge fused with divine power would bring about destruction.""","""You're not a god—gods simply don't bleed,"" Zack said with contempt. After slipping his Holy blade back into its sheath, he distanced himself from the bleeding figure claiming divinity on the cobblestones. As he continued his roaming journey, he reflected on the events leading here. In ages past, gods and humans lived in balance, humans sacrificing and worshipping as gods bestowed protection and blessings. That changed with the Rift. About 1000 years ago, the Great Divide plunged the world into disorder. Some divine beings wished to grant humans godlike powers, motivated by humans' loyalty and their unique power unknown to gods: LOVE. The supreme entities denied the proposal out of fear that human war and vengeance, combined with divine power, would lead to the world’s end."""

Our Hero witnessed the Puppeteer's grip upon our hearts that first night, fingers pulling, kissing, embracing, infecting our bedsheets. Our love burned through fiery eyes, souls torn by blind lust until the Hero ripped open the Puppeteer's monster maw. On the second night, following our plates laden and wasteful, he discovered The Cherub, hateful and fat, vomiting bile. The Hero burned him alive. The Cherub had a brother—the third fiend, the metallic Skitterer, whispering dreams inside ears, promising gains for gathering poisonous green leaves. The Hero left its eight legs visible in the sky. Then came the Monkey King, his laugh mad and wild, staff in hand."

I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue.

Thematically, it reminded me of the overarching theme in The Dark Tower series. Hana was a fascinating (and personally appealing) character. I like understated tough characters. I got drawn in because I started to wonder why Hana kept taking on the hero role, even though she was reluctant. The writing style often distances the reader from the action, which I think was deliberate since dialogue is sparse. For instance, there's a moment where Hana talks to a goon she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as much as her words allowed, but she struggled to make a proper argument. Regardless of how well her thoughts were formed, they came out as quips. She wasn’t a genius, and wouldn’t resort to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing is portraying a conversation but not actually presenting it in dialogue form.","[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really appreciated this story. Its theme is reminiscent of the core theme in The Dark Tower series. Hana was an intriguing and appealing character to me. I enjoy quiet, strong protagonists. I was hooked because I started to question what drives Hana to keep being the hero despite her reluctance. The writing style is somewhat detached from the action, which seems intentional given the minimal dialogue. For example, Hana has a dialogue with a goon she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as best she could, but couldn’t form a solid argument. No matter how clear her thoughts were, they came out as mere quips. She isn't brilliant but wouldn’t stoop to one-liners if she could avoid them. Here, you're describing the conversation instead of writing it out in direct dialogue.","[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Greetings! I thoroughly enjoyed this work. Its themes recall those found in The Dark Tower series. The character Hana was compelling and appealing to me. I like heroes who are quietly formidable. The story captivated me as I pondered what motivates Hana to keep acting heroically even when she doesn’t want to. The narration tends to stay distant from the action, likely by design due to little spoken exchange. For example, Hana converses with a goon whom she identifies as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as much as words allowed but failed to build an argument. Her every thought formed as a quip. She was no genius and would avoid one-liners if possible. The dialogue is described rather than shown directly.","[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hey there! I quite liked this entry. Thematically, it echoes the grand themes of The Dark Tower series. Hana stood out to me as an interesting and likable figure. Quiet, strong-willed characters appeal to me. I got drawn in because I wondered what compelled Hana to remain the reluctant hero. The style of writing appears deliberately somewhat removed, reflecting the minimal dialogue. For instance, when Hana talks to a goon she recognizes from a store clerk past: > Hana protested in the best way her words could manage, but couldn’t lay out a clear argument. Her well-formed thoughts turned into quips. She wasn’t brilliant and wouldn't stoop to quips willingly. The conversation is inferred rather than quoted directly.","[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hello! I really enjoyed reading this. Its theme brought to mind the overarching ideas from The Dark Tower. I found Hana to be an interesting and appealing character. I’m drawn to quiet yet powerful figures. I kept reading because I was curious what drives Hana to keep being the hero despite her unwillingness. The writing often keeps a distance from action, which feels intentional with the limited dialogue. For example, Hana speaks with a goon she knows was a store clerk before: > Hana objected as best she could in words but couldn’t make a strong argument. Clear thoughts emerged only as quips. She was no genius and would avoid one-liners if she could. The dialogue content is described but not set out.","[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I found this work compelling. The theme reminded me of The Dark Tower’s ultimate themes. Hana was a character that appealed to me for being interesting. I like subtle but tough protagonists. Curiosity about why Hana kept playing the reluctant hero kept me hooked. The writing style somewhat distances itself from the scenes, likely intentionally due to sparse dialogue. For example, Hana talks to a goon she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana’s objections were limited by her words, failing to form a full argument. Despite clarity in thought, her replies came out as quips. She was not a genius and would avoid one-liners if she could.

The  image was a chaotic mess of swirling energy, pulsating with an ethereal glow. It was a sentient, self-aware entity, but not a creature of flesh and blood. It was a manifestation of pure energy, a being of pure information. The implications were profound. This entity, this ""life form"", existed on a plane of existence beyond our understanding, feeding off the vast expanse of the cosmos. It was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, but also a potential threat, a force of nature we were ill-prepared to face.  Anya sighed. ""We've only scratched the surface.""

"The Three Laws

The interview had continued for several hours. Andy could barely stand on his own two feet, a combination of fatigue and anxiety, when Terra, the head of the robotics division, finally dismissed him.

It might sound strange, but once you adjust to the gore, to the blood-splattered walls, the bone shards underfoot as you sneak past police tape, and the pervasive stench of rot and death at each scene, it’s not so bad. It’s actually quite morbidly enjoyable. I’m a butcher’s son by nature, so all the gruesome details don’t bother me. Dad brought home hacked-up lamb with wool still hanging when I was a child.' 'So, Anthony, what exactly is the hardest part of your work?' 'It’s the stigma, definitely. Dates are awful. They say, ""You’re what?"" while sipping Chianti. I reply, ""Serial killer critic."" And then they leave.'","There are food critics and film critics. Then there’s you: a serial killer critic. 'The hardest part isn’t the job itself, really. It might sound strange, but once you acclimate to the gore, the blood-streaked walls and bone fragments on the floor slipping by police lines, and the stench of death overwhelming every scene, it becomes less distressing. Actually, I find it somewhat enjoyable in a dark way. Being the butcher’s son, all the gore doesn’t affect me. My dad brought home butchered lamb with wool still attached when I was a child.' 'So Anthony, what’s truly the hardest part?' 'Well, it’s the social stigma. Dates are horrible. People ask, ""You’re what?"" while sipping Chianti. I say, ""Serial killer critic."" Then they leave immediately.'","There are critics for food and movies. Then there’s you: the serial killer critic. 'The hardest part, I have found, isn’t the job itself. It sounds odd, but once you’re used to the gore, the blood-covered walls, the bone fragments beneath your feet as you slip past police tapes, and the smell of rot and death at every crime scene, it’s not that bad. Surprisingly, it’s even somewhat enjoyable in a morbid sense. Since I’m a butcher’s son, the gory stuff doesn’t bother me. Dad used to come home with lamb carcasses still covered in wool when I was just a child.' 'So, Anthony, what in fact is the toughest part?' 'That would be the stigma. Dates are the worst. They ask, ""You’re what?"" while sipping Chianti. I tell them, ""I’m a serial killer critic."" And they promptly leave.'"
