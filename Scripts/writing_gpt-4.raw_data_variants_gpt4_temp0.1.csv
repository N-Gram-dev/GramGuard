"The legendary Ted from Accounting runs afoul of a new foe: Janice from Accounting, who just doesn't give a fuck. No words written or numbers calculated could deter her from her reckless, yet oddly charming, disregard for standard protocols. She tossed invoices like confetti, and budget constraints? Those were mere suggestions in her world. Ted, ever the stickler for order, found himself swimming against the tide of Janice's unorthodox methodologies. Her audaciousness both intrigued and infuriated him. Their desks, standing as silent battlegrounds, bore the brunt of this silent war. One meticulously organized, the other in a state of ordered chaos. The office, once quite monotonous, was now ablaze with their conflicting personalities. Would Ted bring Janice to heel, or would Janice manage to inject some daring into Ted's by-the-books existence? The battleground had been set and the office waited with bated breath for the accounting duel of the decade.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"An eccentric billionaire has decided two select 2 people and has started giving them 1000 $ daily. One of them uses this money wisely while the other one wastes it extravagantly. 

An eccentric billionaire has decided to select two people and started giving them $1000 daily. One of them, a prudent man named John, uses this money wisely. He uses a part of it for his daily needs, invests a portion of it in stable assets and startups, and generously contributes the rest to charities. This approach not only increases his wealth over time but also brings about a positive impact in his community.

On the other hand, the second recipient, a man named Steve, uses this newfound fortune in a rather lavish and reckless manner. Throwing extravagant parties, purchasing high-end brands, and gambling a substantial chunk of it, Steve quickly burns through the daily allowance with no thought for the future or consideration for others.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of [PI] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the rich complexity of the human mind, much like a vast, delicate wasteland.

The protagonist is the human brain, the 'command center' of our being, yet a fragile canvas painted with thoughts, memories, and emotions. It marvelously portrays the brain as a metaphoric wasteland - barren yet possessing immense potential. This stark contrast highlights the mind's duality: its vulnerability and strength, its silence and noise, its chaos and order.

The narrative takes us on a journey through the labyrinth of cognition, introspection, and mental health. It paints a vivid picture of the brain's inner landscape, often overlooked in our bustling lives. The tale is a profound exploration of pain and resilience, isolation and connection, despair and hope - a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

"A team of Extra Terrestrial scientists reach Earth, which they deemed ""potentially habitable"" from their planet, and are astonished by their findings. Making their way through dense vegetation and bustling cities, they discover a civilization living in harmony with nature and technology, a concept they had only theorized.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 1, 1645h: They say people learn to live when they're forced to. Well, here I am, forced to learn in the most brutal way possible. I can't bring myself to kill anything for food. I've read about people training animals to bring them food.... Might be worth a shot. This might be my first and final entry. Wish my luck, stranger. _______________________________________ Year 20, 1540h (Last day): It's down to the last hour now.

They don't leave the weak, sick or old behind. Hierarchies are obeyed and troublemakers are kicked out, but not killed. This is a good society. A noble one.

My human, my companion, lay unmoving on the cold, hard ground. His once robust heartbeat was now a faint whisper barely discernible beneath the thin layer of torn rags. His breath, once a warm rhythm against the chill, had turned into a weak tremor. I nudged my snout into his hand, seeking warmth, longing for a familiar touch, but there was only coldness. His eyes, once filled with unspoken stories and silenced laughter, were now veiled with a distressing emptiness. 

The world continued to spin around us, indifferent and distant. The city's lights were a cruel mimicry of the stars, illuminating yet empty. I laid my head on his chest, listening to the rhythm that was my lullaby on countless nights. I sensed its end drawing near, a chapter closing, leaving me in the cold embrace of solitude.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her arms wrapped around her shins locking them firmly in place as she shook quietly. Jenny's room was nearly empty, all that remained were some old chests, dressers and the bare bed on which she curled. In a large cardboard box, the kind that sagged along the bottom with crinkled corners, thick tape all around and sharpie on the sides were all her earthly possessions. Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt conflicted, a mix of sadness, anger and pain welled deep within her. She had more questions than answers and no one left to talk to. On one hand, she was rather hurt that everything that helped make her *her* could fit into such little space. On the other, she was sad that after today she would be alone again, thrown",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you.

In the realm of ancient fables and legends, there exists a captivating creation myth about the origin of shadows. The myth hails from the indigenous tribes of Polynesia, who believed in a primordial world devoid of light and darkness, a world only of eternal twilight. They worshipped an all-powerful deity named Kāne, the god of light, and his polar opposite brother, Kāne-Mā, the god of darkness. 

Their legend illustrates an epic battle between the two divine entities, where Kāne, in his quest to bring brightness to the world, thrust a spear of pure sunlight into the heart of his brother. As Kāne-Mā fell, he split into countless pieces, each one becoming a shadow, a dark echo of every creature and object touched by Kāne's radiant spear.

"In a world full of supervillains, one man has a very unique job: Finding a practical use for all those wacky doomsday devices.

His resourcefulness turns abandoned evil lairs into scientific gold mines. An earthquake maker becomes a seismic analysis tool, a freeze ray assists in medical cryopreservation research, and an asteroid magnet aids in studying space debris.

"Your ascent into sanity. The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four grueling months of psychological warfare. It was not the diabolical figure one might picture, but rather, my own destructive thoughts. This battle waged within the confines of my mind, the battlefield invisible to the naked eye.

"Quentin Tarantino gives up violence and profanity ""Hey, Sam, glad you could make it. Did you get a chance to read the script?"" Quentin Tarantino's greeting, devoid of his characteristic expletives, caused a ripple of surprise in the room that day.

Quentin Tarantino, renowned for his graphically violent and expletive-laden movies, had taken an unexpected turn. Gone were the blood-soaked frames and stinging profanities; in their place was a script filled with profound introspection and subtle humor. The film industry was abuzz with speculation and intrigue.

There was something chillingly sinister about a boy alone in his room, facing the demons of the night. *Monsters aren't real,* Tim reassured himself, pulling the covers over his face. *If they were, mom and dad would have told me how to run away.* Feeling comforted, Tim lowered the covers to his chin and turned his head back toward the darkness."
"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In the realm of fiction, this maxim stands as an authentic beacon of wisdom. But if we delve deeper, it uncovers a paradox. For, in fiction, the beginning is not always at the start, and the end is not always where you stop. Instead, the canvas of imagination is loomed with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending at its own accord. It is where time is manipulated, blending past, present, and future in a tapestry of tales. It is where reality is an illusion, and illusions form the reality, making boundaries blur and often disappear. Yet, despite these complexities, the essence of storytelling in fiction remains simple. As Carroll suggests, it is about beginning, continuing, and ending - a journey where the start could be the end, and the end, a new beginning. One only needs to remember to stop when they come to the end.",ai,"How should I begin? As the late Lewis Carroll wisely said, ""Start at the beginning and proceed until you reach the end; then stop."" In fiction, this advice serves as a genuine guide. Yet, if we look closer, it reveals a paradox: the beginning isn't always at the start, nor is the end always where you finish. Fiction weaves a complex tapestry of characters, plots, and settings, each with its own start and finish. Time is fluid, blending past, present, and future into a narrative fabric. Reality and illusion intertwine, blurring boundaries. Still, storytelling's core remains straightforward. Following Carroll's words, it's about starting, continuing, and ending—a journey where the start might be the end, and the end a fresh beginning. One must simply remember to stop at the end.","Where do I begin? Lewis Carroll, the great and late author, once said, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.""

"Google goes down, leaving only the message ""go outside"" in place of the normal website. It was all I could do. One last message for all the world to see. I meant it was a symbol of hope, not just for me, but for my fellow Google engineers. Only a handful of us remained, still chained to our desks. We had been forced to write endless lines of code and pursue meaningless projects on the whim of something called the “ Master Page ”. I always thought it was a crude programming reference, but one of my fellow engineers told me it was an actual person. I couldn't believe it. Surely no human being could subject anyone to this kind of insane torture. Yet here we were, bound in service to the Master Page. But it was all coming to an end now. Our Supervisors had departed.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common, cheap, and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" That was the vehement reaction of Samuel Marsh, a dedicated Luddite and activist, to the latest development in this field.

The car, our only means of escape, sputtered and died, surrendering to the crushing tempest. We were stranded, miles away from civilization, in an angry storm that screamed with the fury of a thousand banshees. It was like some cruel joke of the universe, a plot twist in the narrative of our lives that none of us saw coming.

The cold seeped into our bones, a relentless, icy fiend that made the rain seem almost friendly. Fear hung in the air, tangible and chilling. The situation was dire; it was either fabricate a miracle or surrender to the unforgiving wilderness. We huddled together in the dying car, our hearts pounding in sync with the rhythm of the storm.

"Your username vs. Godzilla In the middle of the city, a thunderous roar. As long lasting as an alarm and as earth shattering as an earthquake, it was none other than Godzilla, the creature of terror, rampaging through the city. Buildings crumbled under his colossal feet, fires roared around him as his nuclear breath turned steel into molten lava. In the midst of this chaos, the city's only hope was a single entity: Your Username.

Your Username was swift, agile, a stark contrast to Godzilla's brute strength. His intellect and quick-thinking were his biggest weapons. He skilfully maneuvered around the city, outsmarting Godzilla at every turn, using the destruction caused by the monster itself to trap it. He used technology and strategy, turning the city's ruins into a labyrinth, his mind always two steps ahead of the behemoth.

Their battle was one of brawn versus brain, strength versus strategy. It was a spectacle that held the city in suspense. As the dust settled, one question loomed large: would Your Username's wit be enough to quell Godzilla's wrath?",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"A lifetime to build, yet a moment to destroy it all. Millions of grains had fallen from the miniature spouts guided by the sure hands of a master craftsman. His fingers moved deftly with a precision honed from decades of practice.

"You're playing Scrabble with the devil for your soul. ""SON OF A BITCH"" he screamed, obviously contemplating flipping the board. ""Satan my kids are sleeping do you mind?"" I said calmly. He eyed my furiously; contempt oozing from his glare. ""Did you sneak out ALL of the vowels"" he squeezed through gritted teeth. I shook the letter bag at him. ""Does it sound like letters are missing? I know you're down but have some class Satan"" I said perhaps too cold. He mumbled a few things under his breath and went back to struggling to make a word. He finally gets down ""glare"" and I chuckle a little. The words finally start to go down at a good pace until I have one letter left. Satan smiling openly due to his twenty point lead and only a single letter left. I place the ""X"" above the I and get the triple",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
"""Well.... Shit."" Well.... Shit. The rain hammered the ground. Sheets of water poured themselves over the landscape. It was difficult to see through the vale, but I could see it. A massive fireball erupted just a couple of miles away. Moments later I felt it. The smashing, thudding, sensation of a shock wave, followed instantly by a loud boom. I stumbled backwards as the pressure ripped through my body, taking me by surprise. This definitely wasn't a movie, the sound and flash perfectly in sync. This was real. I sat down on a large rock.'Well.... shit,' I mumbled. The fireball was gone now, but the fire blazed strong, fighting the natural elements that were it's enemy. It licked skyward. I couldn't see the smoke in the rain, but I could see the flames. Water splashed in my eyes, and was streaming down my face, and yet it didn't seem to have any impact on the inferno. I stood up.'Well.... shit!' I yelled and stomped my boot. I stared down at the detonator switch on the ground.",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

Struck down in their greatest moments and dragged into the darkness of their own despair. The eerie silence of the blood swamp was their only solace.

In this realm of mist and mud, they were at home, their sins camouflaged by the thick fog of the swamp. They found an odd solace in their shared misfortune, forming a desolate community of their own.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was carrying an invisible burden. Her name was Clara, and she was the one who had witnessed it all: The day Death died. 

Just hours ago, she had come across a grim, shadowy figure, collapsed in a quiet alley. It was Death, the infamous harbinger of the end, now at his own end. Clara, overcome with a strange sense of compassion, cradled his spectral head in her lap as he drew his final nonexistent breaths. With Death's demise, the world became a place of perpetual existence. 

However, immortality didn't feel like the blessing people had always imagined. The natural cycle was disrupted, bringing unforeseen consequences. The world was suddenly flooded with fear of the unknown, of an eternity too vast to comprehend.

She was the only witness to the day Death died. Hours earlier, she had found a grim, shadowy figure collapsed in a quiet alley—it was Death, the infamous ender of life, now at his own end. Filled with compassion, Clara cradled his spectral head as he took his final breath. With Death's passing, the world became immortal. However, immortality was not the blessing people had imagined. The natural cycle was broken, leading to unforeseen consequences. The world was flooded with fear of an endless unknown. Clara, the secret custodian, contemplated the irony that life lost its preciousness with Death gone. She sat on the park bench amidst the vibrant autumn colors."

Lily hesitated. She stared for a second at the laughing faces on television before shaking herself back to reality. A breath slowly left her mouth. ""Stop joking. It isn't funny.""

"There are food critics and movie critics. Then there's you: the serial killer critic. 'The hardest part, I find, is not the research or the analysis, but the detached approach one must maintain. It's a deadly profession, not in the physical sense, but in its psychological impacts.

As a serial killer critic, I must understand the minds and methods, not to glorify them, but to elucidate the twisted world they inhabit. I delve into the chilling details of their macabre acts, examining them under the harsh lens of critical analysis to extract patterns, motives, and perhaps even signs of remorse. 

This isn't without its dangers. The nightmares, the constant looking over the shoulder, the bizarre understanding of the dark abyss that is the human mind, it takes a toll. But there's a perverse sense of satisfaction in confronting and analyzing this darkness, in aiming to derive some knowledge from the chaos.

The angels, heavenly guardians of eternal bliss, now roamed aimlessly, their luminescent wings tainted with sorrow and ashes.

"A world where the colonial powers were cultists of eldritch gods instead of Protestant Christians/Catholics, is a realm of captivatingly dark intrigue. Wibble, wibble, the chants would echo in the night, as the cultists offered sacrifices to their arcane deities.

In such a world, hidden spheres of influence would be more critical than economic or military might. Powerful shamans would replace priests, their eerie spells bearing the force of divine edicts. Instead of crosses, the sigils of eldritch deities would be emblazoned on flags and banners, casting long, ominous shadows over newly conquered lands. 

The indigenous people, their cultures replaced by alien rituals and rites, would be forced into an uncanny servitude - not just of body but also of soul.

"A person is stood in their boss's office, getting ready to tell them they quit. I paced the room with the entire weight of my body crashing down, a torrent of trepidation engulfing me. The wallpaper seemed to have grown eyes, scrutinizing my every move, the antique clock's ticking echoing my hammering heart.

I felt the familiar metallic taste of fear at the back of my throat, yet beneath that was an undercurrent of relief, liberation even.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere",human,"Let's begin with a younger, less violently formed universe that contains significantly more mass. The space between worlds is filled with breathable air at a pressure that supports life. Solar heat thins this atmosphere to near vacuum near the sun's surface and heats it to plasma at closer ranges. Hot, charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases in along the plane perpendicular to that, creating a convection current. Due to the sun's changing magnetic field, this current is unpredictable and may involve multiple simultaneous currents. This convection-driven heat transfer results in extremely hot areas near the sun, but a vast habitable zone farther out. Solar winds here are literal winds, strong except at great distances from the sun. The increased total mass leads to more planets, which formed within an atmosphere.","Imagine a much younger universe with far more mass and less violent origins. The void between planets is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure levels. Near the sun, heat thins this air to near vacuum and turns it into plasma at close proximity. Charged hot gases are pushed out along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane at right angles, creating a convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, this current can be unpredictable and may consist of multiple currents simultaneously. This convection transfers heat so that while areas near the sun are extremely hot, the habitable zone is very large. Solar winds here are actual winds, strong except far from the sun. The greater mass results in more planets forming within an atmosphere.","Consider a universe that is younger and formed less violently, containing much more mass.

"Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her vacant eyes pooled with unshed tears as she clung to her stuffed bunny.

"Write an erotic story using the worst slang terms possible for each act/body part. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like an eternity. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like hours, my mind a whirl of confusion and curiosity. 

In front of me lay the most perplexing piece of literature I'd ever come across. Covertly disguised as a naughty narrative, this piece was a bewildering mix of the most bizarre slang terms known to human language. It read like a field guide for misunderstood metaphors, a treasure trove of naughty nomenclature. 

Each sentence was a head-scratching enigma. The author had tossed away the conventional norms of erotic fiction and dived headfirst into the realm of the unconventional. The body parts were expressed through a smorgasbord of wildly imaginative metaphors that left you blushing, chuckling, or utterly baffled. 

There was a perverse genius to it all, the way each act was described using the most unorthodox language was oddly captivating.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry Day 3: First Entry

Today marks my first day in this vast, unending wilderness. My only companions are towering trees and distant mountains, their immense stillness echoing my isolation. Survival, once a distant concept, is now my reality. I spent the day gathering berries and hunting for edible roots. Water, thankfully, is abundant thanks to a nearby stream. The solitude is both peaceful and terrifying, a paradox of emotions I cannot fully grasp. I wonder if this newfound silence will drive me mad or if it will serve as a haven from the chaos of my previous life.

Day 7,300: Last Entry

Twenty years have passed since my banishment. The wilderness, once daunting, has become my refuge. I've learnt to find solace in nature, in observing the subtle changes of seasons, the quiet conversations of the forest. I've become a part of them, unremarkable yet essential. The man who was banished is not the man who now writes this.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years, you've become jaded and bored, robbed of the thrills and uncertainties that make life worth living. Death, an unknown abyss for most, holds no more mysteries for you. You are trapped in a cycle of endless rebirth, each revival a monotonous repetition of the last. 

Every relationship you build is transient, ephemeral compared to your endless existence. Love, friendship, enmity - all lose their charm. Time, your one true companion, has become an adversary, a cruel joke. Cities rise and fall, civilizations evolve, the world changes, but you remain constant, untouched by the ravages of time. 

This immortality, once a blessing, now feels like a curse. Eternal life, the dream of many, has become your nightmare.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry I don't know where to begin. I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually. We were blindfolded soon after we were taken, so I don't have a clear idea of where I exactly am. All I know is that we're on our own. Thirty separated into ones. I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies.
