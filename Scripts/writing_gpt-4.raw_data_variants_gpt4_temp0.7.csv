"An eccentric billionaire has decided two select 2 people and has started giving them 1000 $ daily. One of them uses this money wisely while the other one wastes it extravagantly. 

An eccentric billionaire has decided to select two people and started giving them $1000 daily. One of them, a prudent man named John, uses this money wisely. He uses a part of it for his daily needs, invests a portion of it in stable assets and startups, and generously contributes the rest to charities. This approach not only increases his wealth over time but also brings about a positive impact in his community.

On the other hand, the second recipient, a man named Steve, uses this newfound fortune in a rather lavish and reckless manner. Throwing extravagant parties, purchasing high-end brands, and gambling a substantial chunk of it, Steve quickly burns through the daily allowance with no thought for the future or consideration for others.

I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the rich complexity of the human mind, much like a vast, delicate wasteland.

The protagonist is the human brain, the 'command center' of our being, yet a fragile canvas painted with thoughts, memories, and emotions. It marvelously portrays the brain as a metaphoric wasteland - barren yet possessing immense potential. This stark contrast highlights the mind's duality: its vulnerability and strength, its silence and noise, its chaos and order.

The narrative takes us on a journey through the labyrinth of cognition, introspection, and mental health. It paints a vivid picture of the brain's inner landscape, often overlooked in our bustling lives.

"You are a teenager with the ability to measure how ""Dangerous"" people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. Life is a unique spectacle for you as you navigate through high school, scanning classmates with your clandestine gift. You are the human equivalent of a danger-meter, able to discern the threat level of individuals radiating from a scale of one to ten. This unusual ability has become your secret weapon, allowing you to avoid threat before it even materializes. 

However, it is not as exciting as it sounds. Often, it's a burden you bear silently, knowing which peers are troublemakers, which teachers possess a concealed wrath, and who among the crowd is authentic or deceitful. The worst part is the isolation, as you bear the weight of knowledge that you can't share with anyone.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice.

"A Creation Myth / Myth in General. Example: source of night & day, how islands or mountains formed, why do shadows exist?, why pain A Creation Myth: The Origin of Shadows

In the realm of ancient fables and legends, there exists a captivating creation myth about the origin of shadows. The myth hails from the indigenous tribes of Polynesia, who believed in a primordial world devoid of light and darkness, a world only of eternal twilight. They worshipped an all-powerful deity named Kāne, the god of light, and his polar opposite brother, Kāne-Mā, the god of darkness. 

Their legend illustrates an epic battle between the two divine entities, where Kāne, in his quest to bring brightness to the world, thrust a spear of pure sunlight into the heart of his brother. As Kāne-Mā fell, he split into countless pieces, each one becoming a shadow, a dark echo of every creature and object touched by Kāne's radiant spear. 

Thus, for every beam of light in the day, there is a shadow in the evening, a constant reminder",ai,"In ancient Polynesian mythology, there is a fascinating creation story explaining the origin of shadows. It tells of a world initially without light or darkness, only eternal twilight, governed by Kāne, the god of light, and his brother Kāne-Mā, the god of darkness. Their legendary struggle culminated with Kāne piercing Kāne-Mā with a spear of sunlight, causing his brother to shatter into numerous fragments that became shadows cast by all beings and objects. Hence, every ray of daylight has a corresponding shadow, symbolizing this eternal duality.","The Polynesian creation myth recounts the birth of shadows from a primordial twilight world ruled by two brothers: Kāne, the light god, and Kāne-Mā, the god of darkness. In their fierce battle, Kāne drove a spear of pure sunlight into Kāne-Mā, who broke apart, each fragment becoming a shadow that followed every living thing. This myth explains why light and shadow exist side by side, with shadows appearing wherever sunlight touches.","According to an ancient Polynesian legend, shadows originated from an eternal twilight realm where light and darkness had yet to exist. The god of light, Kāne, and his brother Kāne-Mā, god of darkness, fought fiercely until Kāne struck his brother with a spear of sunlight. Kāne-Mā shattered, and his pieces became shadows that trail all creatures and items illuminated by the sun’s rays. This tale accounts for the presence of shadows alongside daylight.","The origin of shadows is told in a Polynesian myth where a world of constant twilight gave way to light and dark through the conflict of two gods: Kāne, who embodies light, and his brother Kāne-Mā, who embodies darkness. Kāne’s spear of sunlight pierced Kāne-Mā, breaking him into many parts that turned into shadows cast by every object touched by light. Thus, the myth reveals why shadows accompany every beam of sunlight.","In Polynesian mythology, a creation myth explains shadows as remnants of a battle between Kāne, god of light, and Kāne-Mā, god of darkness. Originally, their world was one of endless twilight without true light or darkness. When Kāne struck Kāne-Mā with a spear of light, his brother shattered into pieces that became shadows, forever linked to the creatures and objects illuminated by sunlight.","A captivating Polynesian creation myth describes how shadows came to be in a world once shrouded in perpetual twilight. The gods Kāne and Kāne-Mā, representing light and darkness, fought until Kāne’s spear of sunlight pierced Kāne-Mā, who then fragmented into countless shadows that cling to all things touched by light, explaining the coexistence of light and shadow.","The Polynesian tribes tell a creation myth about shadows originating from a world of unending twilight governed by two brothers: Kāne, god of light, and Kāne-Mā, god of darkness.

"Quentin Tarantino gives up violence and profanity ""Hey, Sam, glad you could make it. Did you get a chance to read the script?"" Quentin Tarantino's greeting, devoid of his characteristic expletives, caused a ripple of surprise in the room that day.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In the realm of fiction, this maxim stands as an authentic beacon of wisdom. But if we delve deeper, it uncovers a paradox. For, in fiction, the beginning is not always at the start, and the end is not always where you stop. Instead, the canvas of imagination is loomed with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending at its own accord. It is where time is manipulated, blending past, present, and future in a tapestry of tales. It is where reality is an illusion, and illusions form the reality, making boundaries blur and often disappear. Yet, despite these complexities, the essence of storytelling in fiction remains simple. As Carroll suggests, it is about beginning, continuing, and ending - a journey where the start could be the end, and the end, a new beginning. One only needs to remember to stop when they come to the end.",ai,"How should I begin? As the late, great Lewis Carroll said, ""Start at the beginning and proceed until you reach the end: then stop."" This advice serves as true wisdom in fiction. Yet, if we examine it closer, a paradox emerges. In fiction, the beginning isn’t always the start, nor the end the final stop. The imaginative world is woven with complex threads of characters, plots, and settings, each with its own start and finish. Time is fluid here, merging past, present, and future into a narrative tapestry. Reality blurs with illusion, making boundaries fade or vanish. Despite this, the core of storytelling remains simple. Carroll’s guidance stands: begin, continue, and end—a journey where the start can be the end, and the end, a fresh start. One must only remember to stop upon reaching the end.","Where do I begin? Lewis Carroll famously advised, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This principle is a genuine guide in fiction. However, a deeper look reveals a paradox. In fiction, beginnings may not be at the start, and endings may not be where the story ceases. The imaginative realm is tangled with characters, plots, and settings, each with their own timelines. Time intertwines past, present, and future, creating a rich tapestry of stories. Reality and illusion merge, blurring lines until they vanish. Yet, storytelling’s essence is simple: as Carroll said, start, proceed, and stop. The journey may have a start that’s also an end, and an end that’s a new beginning. Remember to stop once you reach the end.","How do I initiate? The late Lewis Carroll’s words echo, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.""

The fabric of imagination is woven with characters, plots, and settings, each with their own start and end points. Time is flexible, blending past, present, and future into a story tapestry. Reality becomes illusion, illusions shape reality, and boundaries blur or vanish. Still, storytelling’s heart is simple: start, continue, and end as Carroll advises. The start may be the end, and the end may be a fresh start. One must stop upon reaching that end.","Where to start?

One only needs to remember to stop upon reaching the end.","How do I begin the tale? Lewis Carroll wisely said, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This phrase is a true beacon in fiction. But if we look deeper, a paradox emerges. In fiction, beginnings are not always at the start, nor are endings always where you stop. The imaginative tapestry is woven with characters, plots, and settings, each with their own beginnings and ends. Time is fluid, blending past, present, and future into stories. Reality and illusion intertwine, blurring boundaries until they vanish. Still, the essence of storytelling remains simple: as Carroll suggests, begin, continue, and end—a journey where the start can be the end, and the end a fresh start. One should only stop when reaching the end.","How do I begin? Lewis Carroll’s timeless advice rings clear: ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" This guidance serves as a true compass in fiction. Yet, upon deeper reflection, a paradox appears. In fiction, the beginning isn’t always the start, nor the end the final stop. The imaginative realm is woven with characters, plots, and settings, each having their own start and end. Time bends, merging past, present, and future into a story tapestry. Reality and illusion blend, blurring or erasing boundaries. Nevertheless, storytelling’s heart remains simple: start, continue, and end. The journey may begin where it ends, and end where it begins. Just remember to stop at the end."

I meant it was a symbol of hope, not just for me, but for my fellow Google engineers. Only a handful of us remained, still chained to our desks. We had been forced to write endless lines of code and pursue meaningless projects on the whim of something called the “ Master Page ”. I always thought it was a crude programming reference, but one of my fellow engineers told me it was an actual person. I couldn't believe it. Surely no human being could subject anyone to this kind of insane torture. Yet here we were, bound in service to the Master Page. But it was all coming to an end now. Our Supervisors had departed.

I want to say, ""No. I don’t know you, and you don’t know me. Just stop."" But if I do, I’ll be the mean one, not him, who’s totally freaking me out. Remember Tony? I told him I wasn’t interested in dating anyone, and he went around screaming that I ""friend-zoned"" him. Sorry I just wanted to stay friends? What does that even mean?

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common, cheap, and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" That was the vehement reaction of Samuel Marsh, a dedicated Luddite and activist, to the latest development in this field. He's part of a shrinking minority who fear that humanity is losing its essence in the endless drive towards technological advancement.

For them, the idea of replacing an arm, an eye, or even a kidney with synthetic, machine components is nothing short of a nightmare. For the rest of us, the wonders of cybernetic technology are a lifeline, a chance at a normal life, even an improved life.

Imagine being free from the threat of degenerative diseases, from the specter of disability. Sadly, those like Marsh can't see past their fear of the new and unknown. The reality is, technology is not the enemy of humanity; it's a tool that can make our lives better, if we let it",ai,"Society has advanced to the stage where cybernetic implants are widespread, affordable, and remarkable.

A cure for all the internet trolls, cyber-bullies, and keyboard warriors that spread negativity and hatred. The device, dubbed, ""The Retribution Retractor,"" was not made of menace. Instead, it was a metaphorical tool, one that reflected the pain they inflicted on others back onto them. It did not physically harm but offered a mirror into the emotional trauma they were creating. Each hurtful comment, each vicious attack, would send a sharp jolt of reality to its sender, allowing them to experience the emotional pain they were inflicting on others. The users would receive the jolt not in physical form, but as a sudden, overwhelming wave of empathy and understanding. The cure was not about revenge; it was about teaching a lesson. It was about turning these keyboard warriors into compassionate communicators, to create a more empathetic and humane internet ecosystem.

"Meet & Greet/Weekly Question #3: What do you look for in a WP response? What do I look for in a WP response? First, originality is paramount. A response that takes a prompt in an unexpected direction, goes beyond the obvious, and surprises me is always a delight. Second, quality writing. Precise language, well-constructed sentences, and a keen sense of narrative rhythm can make a post stand out. Third, engagement with the prompt. The finest posts are those that use the prompt as a diving board, not just a lifebuoy. They don't just answer the question or fulfill the request, but expand it and explore its implications. Lastly, I look for a sense of personality. A response that feels human, that exposes a bit of the writer's soul is the most engaging of all.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was carrying an invisible burden. Her name was Clara, and she was the one who had witnessed it all: The day Death died. 

Just hours ago, she had come across a grim, shadowy figure, collapsed in a quiet alley. It was Death, the infamous harbinger of the end, now at his own end. Clara, overcome with a strange sense of compassion, cradled his spectral head in her lap as he drew his final nonexistent breaths. With Death's demise, the world became a place of perpetual existence. 

However, immortality didn't feel like the blessing people had always imagined. The natural cycle was disrupted, bringing unforeseen consequences. The world was suddenly flooded with fear of the unknown, of an eternity too vast to comprehend.

"If you had to choose, which of your prompt responses would you say is the best you've written? The beach was beautiful that day. The sky was a perfect carousel of clouds around a brilliant sun. The ocean sprayed a mist of cool, salty air, painting a breathtaking picture of tranquility. This scene became the backdrop of a poignant tale of love and loss, an exploration of the human heart's resilience. This story stands out in my mind as my best work. It breathed life into characters that were so real, so palpably human, that they almost jumped off the page. The compelling narrative danced in harmony with the strikingly detailed descriptions, tugging at heartstrings and leaving a lasting impression. The story served as a vivid reminder of the power of words, their ability to transport us to different worlds, painting vivid pictures in our minds, and eliciting a cornucopia of emotions.

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020.

"There are food critics and movie critics. Then there's you: the serial killer critic. 'The hardest part, I find, is not the research or the analysis, but the detached approach one must maintain. It's a deadly profession, not in the physical sense, but in its psychological impacts.

I delve into the chilling details of their macabre acts, examining them under the harsh lens of critical analysis to extract patterns, motives, and perhaps even signs of remorse.

Since Alan Turing, the theory of Advanced General Intelligence or Advanced Super Intelligence had existed—intelligences at or beyond human level capable of pattern detection..."

I've lived next door to Mr. Harlow for 20 years and he never said more than a nod of acknowledgment. He lived in a cocoon of grief and loneliness, his only companion: silence. One day, a chatty, seven-year-old girl, Daisy, moved into our neighborhood. Undeterred by his frosty exterior, Daisy would visit Mr. Harlow daily, filling his quiet world with her innocent banter. She'd read stories, recite poems, and tell tales from school. One day, a miracle happened. Daisy had asked a question about a bird she saw in his garden and Mr. Harlow, almost involuntarily, answered her. His voice, rusty but clear, broke the years of silence that hung heavy around him.

"We've explored space and found life, though it doesn't ""live"" in a way we've expected. “ Okay, so what am I supposed to tell you exactly?” The question hung in the air, filled with the weight of the unknown. We’ve explored space and found life, though it doesn't ""live"" in a way we've expected. These beings, if we can call them that, exist in a state of energy and consciousness rather than as physical entities. They don’t breathe, eat, or sleep, but communicate in pulses of electromagnetic waves. It's a form of existence that turns our understanding of life on its head. This discovery has left us questioning everything we thought we knew about the universe, and our place within it.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere",human,"Let's create a universe that's younger and formed less violently, containing significantly more mass. The space between planets is filled with breathable air at a pressure that supports life. Solar heat thins this air to near vacuum near the sun's surface and turns it into plasma closer to the sun. Charged hot gases are pushed out along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane perpendicular to that, creating a kind of convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, this current is unpredictable and may consist of several currents simultaneously. This convection-driven heat transfer results in a vast habitable zone, despite the scorching conditions near the sun. Solar winds are genuine winds, strong except far from the sun. The increased total mass results in more planets forming, but these planets develop within an atmosphere.","Imagine a younger, gentler-formed universe with much more mass. The gaps between worlds are filled with breathable air at a pressure that supports survival. Near the sun, heat thins this atmosphere to near vacuum and turns it into plasma at closer distances. Hot, charged gases escape along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases along a perpendicular plane, generating a convection current. Due to the sun's changing magnetic field, this current can be erratic and may include multiple currents simultaneously. The overall heat transfer from this convection means that although the sun's vicinity is extremely hot, the habitable zone is vast. Solar winds are actual winds and can be quite strong except when far from the sun. This greater mass leads to more planets forming, all within an atmosphere.","Consider a universe that's much younger and less violently formed, packed with a lot more mass. The void between planets contains breathable air at a pressure suitable for life. Solar heat reduces this air to near vacuum near the sun’s surface and converts it to plasma closer in. Hot charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, pulling cooler gases in along a plane at right angles, creating a convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, this current is unpredictable and may consist of several currents at once.

"Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her vacant eyes pooled with unshed tears as she clung to her stuffed bunny. The bunny, threadbare and faded, was a silent testament to the countless nights it offered comfort through the ghostly shadows and thunderous roars of nightmares. It sagged, a silent observer, to her whispered secrets and untold dreams, its stitched smile a constant in the chaos of her world. The bond forged between them was unbreakable, the memories irreplaceable. As she grew older, though, her parents insisted it was time to let go. But how can one simply release a treasured friend held so close to the heart? The bunny wasn't simply an inanimate object, but a part of her fragmented innocence. As she held it tighter, she made a silent vow - she would never leave her silent companion behind.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"Write an erotic story using the worst slang terms possible for each act/body part. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like an eternity. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like hours, my mind a whirl of confusion and curiosity.

It read like a field guide for misunderstood metaphors, a treasure trove of naughty nomenclature. 

Each sentence was a head-scratching enigma. The author had tossed away the conventional norms of erotic fiction and dived headfirst into the realm of the unconventional. The body parts were expressed through a smorgasbord of wildly imaginative metaphors that left you blushing, chuckling, or utterly baffled.

The startling reality of my banishment has begun to sink in. As I look out into the endless expanse of wilderness, I feel a wave of terror and loneliness overwhelm me. No familiar faces or comforting surroundings, just the raw, indifferent power of nature. I've been given the basic tools for survival. A sharp knife, a tattered map, and my own wits.

Sometimes it’s his maniacal cackling late at night, sometimes small contained explosions occur in his backyard, and sometimes it’s the company he keeps. Despite all these annoying quirks, he’s actually a good neighbor. Living next to him is certainly interesting, and though he has a few faults, I can name several good things about him. For example, he runs the neighborhood watch—or more precisely, he *is* the neighborhood watch—with his armada of drones constantly monitoring the neighborhood.

"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. I'm not a compulsive liar. I know that's what you think. I know that's what everyone has come to think. It's difficult. I don't expect you to understand. You won't. But I will tell you the truth, it's what I owe you, even if my life.... this life.... is ruined. You see, I'm not who you think I am. It's hard for me to make it simple. I am who you think I am, but I am more than that. I'm your husband, I'm the science teacher at school, I'm the man who bought you flowers yesterday. But I am also an astronaut name James York, I am a truck driver named Herb Johnson, and a myriad different things. I know this sounds insane to you, but it's true. I'm not originally from Russia.

"You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years, you've become jaded and bored, robbed of the thrills and uncertainties that make life worth living. Death, an unknown abyss for most, holds no more mysteries for you.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry I don't know where to begin. I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually. We were blindfolded soon after we were taken, so I don't have a clear idea of where I exactly am. All I know is that we're on our own. Thirty separated into ones. I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies. This is the last thing I've found in it, along with a dull pocket knife, a canteen water bottle, a pen and some thin string, which I've been using for snares. When I was recruited for this project, I thought I would be helping humanity. Working towards a greater good. But now, now I see what this corrupt government is really",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
