An eccentric billionaire has decided to select two people and started giving them $1000 daily. One of them, a prudent man named John, uses this money wisely. He uses a part of it for his daily needs, invests a portion of it in stable assets and startups, and generously contributes the rest to charities. This approach not only increases his wealth over time but also brings about a positive impact in his community.

On the other hand, the second recipient, a man named Steve, uses this newfound fortune in a rather lavish and reckless manner. Throwing extravagant parties, purchasing high-end brands, and gambling a substantial chunk of it, Steve quickly burns through the daily allowance with no thought for the future or consideration for others.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of [PI] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the rich complexity of the human mind, much like a vast, delicate wasteland.

The protagonist is the human brain, the 'command center' of our being, yet a fragile canvas painted with thoughts, memories, and emotions. It marvelously portrays the brain as a metaphoric wasteland - barren yet possessing immense potential. This stark contrast highlights the mind's duality: its vulnerability and strength, its silence and noise, its chaos and order.

The narrative takes us on a journey through the labyrinth of cognition, introspection, and mental health. It paints a vivid picture of the brain's inner landscape, often overlooked in our bustling lives. The tale is a profound exploration of pain and resilience, isolation and connection, despair and hope - a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.""

If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow.

Don’t worry if your writing is bad. That’s actually a good sign. If it’s bad, it means you’re clearing out the bad writing to make room for better writing. Not everyone will become a good writer, but no one becomes one without first doing some bad writing. In closing, I recommend the 48th Dear Sugar advice column titled *Write Like A Motherfucker* (http://therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). While it specifically addresses writing as a female, its advice is universal, as this quote reveals: > Writing is hard for every last one of us."""

"Something about cryogenic freezing and a person waking up to ask a computer, ""How Long? ``. ""Ugh, I was never good at math.""

Something about cryogenic freezing and a person waking up to ask a computer, ""How Long?"" ""Ugh, I was never good at math."" Groaning with the effort, he peered at the digital display hovering in the air. The numbers were too alien, too advanced for his 21st-century mind to comprehend. 

He had agreed to this – to sleep away the millennia in a cryostasis chamber, only to awaken in an advanced era. A one-way ticket to the future. But the future was more disorienting than he had imagined. It was like waking up from dream to find that the dream was reality. 

The computer, a sentient AI, responded with a number that sent his mind reeling. ""You have been in cryogenic freeze for 3,500 years."" The room spun around him.

Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt conflicted, a mix of sadness, anger and pain welled deep within her. She had more questions than answers and no one left to talk to.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the cerulean expanse of the ocean, the salty breeze rustling my hair as I approach the supposed relic. The bottle, a kaleidoscope of sun-bleached colors, looks ancient. Its glass surface is roughened by the relentless kiss of the sea, and nestled within its hollow depths is a timeworn parchment. 

A sense of profound gravity washes over me as I coax the letter free. The ink has faded but the words remain, a message penned by a hand that has been dust for a century. It is an earnest call across the abyss of time. The writer talks about hopes, dreams, and fears that are uncannily similar to mine. It's a poignant reminder that though times change, the human condition doesn't. In this moment of unexpected connection, I feel less alone, reaching out to the past",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

In the realm of ancient fables and legends, there exists a captivating creation myth about the origin of shadows. The myth hails from the indigenous tribes of Polynesia, who believed in a primordial world devoid of light and darkness, a world only of eternal twilight. They worshipped an all-powerful deity named Kāne, the god of light, and his polar opposite brother, Kāne-Mā, the god of darkness. 

Their legend illustrates an epic battle between the two divine entities, where Kāne, in his quest to bring brightness to the world, thrust a spear of pure sunlight into the heart of his brother. As Kāne-Mā fell, he split into countless pieces, each one becoming a shadow, a dark echo of every creature and object touched by Kāne's radiant spear.

"A Creation Myth / Myth in General. Example: source of night & day, how islands or mountains formed, why do shadows exist?, why pain exists, etc. The battle raged across the darkness. Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life. The mighty epic of the Gods' battle was played in miniature as organisms fought to claim the rock for their Gods.

"There are too many shocking, (albeit awesome) ends to the stories found here. Readers often find themselves submerged in a whirlwind of explosive plots, bracing themselves for a climactic finale. The characters dance around impending doom, conflicts intensify, tension builds, and the readers, well, they anxiously flip pages, hungry for the grand resolution that seems imminent.

However, something unexpected happens. The bomb doesn't explode. The lovers don't reunite. The hero doesn't slay the dragon. Instead, the story takes an unforeseen turn into the realm of the anticlimactic. The bomb is a dud, the lovers part ways, the dragon flies off into the sunrise. The narratives that once promised fireworks end with more of a whimper than a bang.

"Quentin Tarantino gives up violence and profanity ""Hey, Sam, glad you could make it. Did you get a chance to read the script?"" Quentin Tarantino's greeting, devoid of his characteristic expletives, caused a ripple of surprise in the room that day.

Quentin Tarantino, renowned for his graphically violent and expletive-laden movies, had taken an unexpected turn. Gone were the blood-soaked frames and stinging profanities; in their place was a script filled with profound introspection and subtle humor. The film industry was abuzz with speculation and intrigue. How could the man, who immortalized violent vengeance in ""Kill Bill"" and gave us the profanity-riddled ""Pulp Fiction"", renounce his signature style?

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In the realm of fiction, this maxim stands as an authentic beacon of wisdom. But if we delve deeper, it uncovers a paradox. For, in fiction, the beginning is not always at the start, and the end is not always where you stop. Instead, the canvas of imagination is loomed with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending at its own accord. It is where time is manipulated, blending past, present, and future in a tapestry of tales. It is where reality is an illusion, and illusions form the reality, making boundaries blur and often disappear. Yet, despite these complexities, the essence of storytelling in fiction remains simple. As Carroll suggests, it is about beginning, continuing, and ending - a journey where the start could be the end, and the end, a new beginning.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common, cheap, and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" That was the vehement reaction of Samuel Marsh, a dedicated Luddite and activist, to the latest development in this field. He's part of a shrinking minority who fear that humanity is losing its essence in the endless drive towards technological advancement.

For them, the idea of replacing an arm, an eye, or even a kidney with synthetic, machine components is nothing short of a nightmare. For the rest of us, the wonders of cybernetic technology are a lifeline, a chance at a normal life, even an improved life.

Imagine being free from the threat of degenerative diseases, from the specter of disability. Sadly, those like Marsh can't see past their fear of the new and unknown.

Or are dreams just illusions, mere manifestations of yearning? My fingers graze the cold glass of the window, feeling the chill of that question. Perhaps, but in my dreams, you are no less real than the wakeful longing I nurse. As the clock continues its incessant mockery, I am left grappling with these thoughts."""
"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no wars, no violence, only peace and harmony? Let us call it the Universe of Serenity. 

In the Universe of Serenity, planets are sentient beings, having intricate societal structures with their own cultures, languages, and unique forms of life. Each planet is a nation, a state, a collective entity of its own. They communicate through harmonious cosmic vibrations and work together to maintain stability and order in the universe. 

The inhabitants of these planets, referred to as the Life-Bringers, are in complete symbiosis with their celestial homes. In fact, they are the physical manifestation of their planets' consciousness. They thrive on peace, unity, and mutual respect rather than domination or competition.

"An inanimate object comes to life at the worst possible moment. As the British advanced steadily closer, the American infantry scrambled to draw up into formed lines. The cannons, mighty beasts of iron and steel, had lain still and silent, waiting for their command. Suddenly, before any orders are given, one of them roared to life.

A blinding flash, a thunderous boom, and the battlefield was bathed in billowing smoke. The timing was off, the sequence shattered. The British troops, still too far for an effective shot, were alerted to the imminent attack. The cannon's premature eruption had gifted them with a moment's notice, enough to brace themselves, to rally, and to charge.

"You are a spaceman watching the destruction of Earth below you, what are your final thoughts? It was still spinning. Across Asia a wall of water was steadily making its way northwest, toward Russia, a super-massive typhoon that couldn't even be calculated a strength level. You could no longer see the continent of Africa for the violent vortex that blanketed its entirety. And across the pond, back on the Americas a wave of molten fire spread outward from the Midwest of the US as a plume of black choked the atmosphere from Canada to Brazil. It was literally Hell on Earth. All from a single asteroid. Its course had been tracked for a while, but no one expected it to suddenly turn out of nowhere.

The industrial revolution begins in the ancient world, centuries before its due time. Heron, a scholar of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, initially devised the Aeolipile as a temple curiosity, a spinning ball driven by steam as a testament to the gods' powers. When he stumbled upon the practical applications of his creation, he had an epiphany; he realized that this simple device had the potential to transform the world beyond recognition. Harnessing steam's power, he started to design machines that could grind grain, pump water, and even move heavy objects — the first automated systems in history.

A cure for all the internet trolls, cyber-bullies, and keyboard warriors that spread negativity and hatred. The device, dubbed, ""The Retribution Retractor,"" was not made of menace. Instead, it was a metaphorical tool, one that reflected the pain they inflicted on others back onto them. It did not physically harm but offered a mirror into the emotional trauma they were creating. Each hurtful comment, each vicious attack, would send a sharp jolt of reality to its sender, allowing them to experience the emotional pain they were inflicting on others. The users would receive the jolt not in physical form, but as a sudden, overwhelming wave of empathy and understanding. The cure was not about revenge; it was about teaching a lesson. It was about turning these keyboard warriors into compassionate communicators, to create a more empathetic and humane internet ecosystem.

"Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals

I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written, it's not *finished*. Writing, like any other art form, isn't just about creating, it's also about refining. This is where the real test begins, the test of patience and perseverance.

"[ IP ] Blood Swamp Miscreants all of them tangled inside a web of their own misery. Struck down in their greatest moments and dragged [IP] Blood Swamp Miscreants, all of them tangled inside a web of their own misery. Struck down in their greatest moments and dragged into the darkness of their own despair. The eerie silence of the blood swamp was their only solace. A sanctuary for the sinners and a graveyard for their guilt.

Their existence was shrouded in shame, a constant reminder of their grotesque pasts. Each one of them carried a burden, heavy and bitter, their spirits broken, their souls tarnished by their deeds.

"Doctor Pepper must help a Coke addict overcome his affliction. Dr. Pepper watched his patient fidget on the table. ""Give it to me straight Doc, do I have a problem? ``, the man bobbed his knee.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was carrying an invisible burden. Her name was Clara, and she was the one who had witnessed it all: The day Death died. 

Just hours ago, she had come across a grim, shadowy figure, collapsed in a quiet alley. It was Death, the infamous harbinger of the end, now at his own end. Clara, overcome with a strange sense of compassion, cradled his spectral head in her lap as he drew his final nonexistent breaths. With Death's demise, the world became a place of perpetual existence. 

However, immortality didn't feel like the blessing people had always imagined. The natural cycle was disrupted, bringing unforeseen consequences. The world was suddenly flooded with fear of the unknown, of an eternity too vast to comprehend.

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020.

"There are food critics and movie critics. Then there's you: the serial killer critic. 'The hardest part, I find, is not the research or the analysis, but the detached approach one must maintain. It's a deadly profession, not in the physical sense, but in its psychological impacts.

"A world where the colonial powers were cultists of eldritch gods instead of Protestant Christians/Catholics, is a realm of captivatingly dark intrigue. Wibble, wibble, the chants would echo in the night, as the cultists offered sacrifices to their arcane deities.

In such a world, hidden spheres of influence would be more critical than economic or military might. Powerful shamans would replace priests, their eerie spells bearing the force of divine edicts. Instead of crosses, the sigils of eldritch deities would be emblazoned on flags and banners, casting long, ominous shadows over newly conquered lands. 

The indigenous people, their cultures replaced by alien rituals and rites, would be forced into an uncanny servitude - not just of body but also of soul. The horrors of colonial exploitation would assume a darker, more sinister form, as they wouldn't merely be stripped of their lands, they would lose their very identities to the eldritch gods.",ai,"A world where colonial powers serve eldritch gods instead of Protestant Christians or Catholics is filled with dark, captivating intrigue.

The moment lives flicker out, the overwhelming grief, and the silence thereafter, were elements he had never seen up close. In contrast, Death, now glittering in an aura of warmth, was taken aback by the vibrancy and chaos of life. The miracle of birth, the complexity of existence, the constant growth and change - it was all too much, too fast.

"Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four years of constant torture. It has followed me from room to room, day after day. It followed me every time I went out, every time I ate dinner, every time I went to the bathroom. This demon that had sunk its teeth deep into my chest and sucked out my lifeforce leaving only this hollow shell of the person that was. Always there, screaming, demanding to be heard, taking away everything I had ever loved. It had driven away my husband, my reason for living. He turned and fled soon after this evil had descended on us. He was far wiser than I. I stupidly believed that evil could be fought. Its cold eyes were always on me, soulless and demonic.

"Find a random post on r/TIFU and make an explanation for the title without reading the post. TIFU by breathing fire Okay ""Today I Fucked Up by Breathing Fire"" - This headline immediately conjures images of a fantastical mishap, almost like something straight out of a fantasy novel. However, it's more likely a hyperbolic description of a painfully spicy meal or perhaps an ill-advised attempt at fire-breathing.

Considering the nature of the subreddit r/TIFU, where users share their humorous and sometimes cringe-worthy mistakes, it's plausible that the poster tried something daring, most probably involving a chili pepper eating challenge. The 'fire-breathing' could be a metaphorical way to describe the intense and fiery sensation caused by the consumption of ultra-spicy food.

Alternatively, the title might refer to a failed attempt at an actual fire-breathing stunt, like those performed in circuses or magic shows. Whatever the details, it's evident that the end result was less than ideal, leading to a memorable TIFU moment.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

Some called it a fool's errand, but I was driven by the desire to debunk a universally accepted yet scientifically unproven myth.

The Bermuda Triangle, a patch of ocean wedged between Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, has been a source of eerie intrigue for decades.

"You tell Death that you will never tire of living, no matter how long you live. It makes you a bet that you will and thus grants you eternal life. The deal is sealed with a chilling handshake that freezes the blood in your veins, and you find yourself condemned to a never-ending existence.

As time stretches, you witness the birth and death of civilizations, you see empires rise and fall, you watch the stars wither and die. You are an eternal observer, unable to intervene in the course of history. Through millennia, you yearn for the touch of mortality, the finality of an end.

The endless stream of existence becomes a torment, a curse rather than a boon. You realize that the beauty of life lies in its temporality, the fleeting moments of joy, sorrow, love, and loss.

The invasion had swept through our city like a merciless storm, leaving nothing but devastation in its path. Our homes, our schools, the little bakery on the corner, all were reduced to ruins - a grim reflection of our shattered lives. 

The once vibrant cityscape was now a graveyard, our dreams buried deep within its rubble. The skies, once full of kites and birds, now only offered a thick shroud of smoky despair. The streets, once buzzing with life, now echoed with an eerie silence, a chilling testament to our lost battle.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere",human,"Let's begin with a younger, less violently formed universe that contains significantly more mass.

"Write an erotic story using the worst slang terms possible for each act/body part. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like an eternity. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like hours, my mind a whirl of confusion and curiosity. 

In front of me lay the most perplexing piece of literature I'd ever come across. Covertly disguised as a naughty narrative, this piece was a bewildering mix of the most bizarre slang terms known to human language. It read like a field guide for misunderstood metaphors, a treasure trove of naughty nomenclature. 

Each sentence was a head-scratching enigma. The author had tossed away the conventional norms of erotic fiction and dived headfirst into the realm of the unconventional. The body parts were expressed through a smorgasbord of wildly imaginative metaphors that left you blushing, chuckling, or utterly baffled. 

There was a perverse genius to it all, the way each act was described using the most unorthodox language was oddly captivating. Despite the absurdity of the content, I found myself unable to put it",ai,"I sat there, gazing at it for what felt like an eternity, my mind swirling with confusion and curiosity.","For what seemed like hours, I sat there, staring at it, my thoughts a chaotic mix of bewilderment and intrigue.","I remained seated, fixated on it for what appeared to be an endless amount of time, my mind a storm of puzzlement and fascination.","Sitting there, I stared at it endlessly, my mind a whirlpool of perplexity and wonder.","I sat, eyes locked on it for what felt like forever, my thoughts tangled in confusion and curiosity.","For hours on end, I sat there, staring at it, my mind racing with questions and intrigue.","I found myself sitting there, staring at it for what seemed like an age, my mind a blend of confusion and fascination.","There I was, sitting and staring at it for what felt like an eternity, my mind swirling with curiosity and confusion.","I sat motionless, staring at it for what seemed like hours, my mind a whirlwind of curiosity and bewilderment.","For what felt like an endless stretch of time, I sat there, staring at it, my mind caught between confusion and curiosity."

Today marks my first day in this vast, unending wilderness. My only companions are towering trees and distant mountains, their immense stillness echoing my isolation.

The elegance was noted even by the children, seeing the blue rock for the first time through a lens. But the beauty of that land could not contain humanity and our ever-growing demand for the unknown. Wise men called us foolish for leaving. Now even fools can see that our path was the path of prosperity. And the waters ran red. Religion had all but died out among humans. Only a handful of defiant elders remained.
