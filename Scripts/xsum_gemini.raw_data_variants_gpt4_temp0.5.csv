"##  Diamonds Stolen in Daring Airport Heist

Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the gems. The daring heist, which took place at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport, saw thieves make off with a large quantity of diamonds worth an estimated $20 million. 

Authorities are now investigating the brazen crime, which is being described as one of the most sophisticated airport heists in recent years.

"## London's Red Buses Get a Makeover: Engine Removal Proposed for 142 Idle Vehicles

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal, which will be discussed at the next council meeting, could reach £1 million annually. The initiative, driven by the city's environmental and budgetary concerns, would see the repurposed buses used for static purposes, like advertising or mobile libraries. Critics argue the plan could negatively impact London's tourism industry, which relies on the iconic red buses. Proponents, however, believe the change is necessary to adapt to changing needs and prioritize sustainability. The decision will likely be a hotly contested one, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.

"## TfL Proposes New Driver Tests: Language, Navigation, and Landline Required

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a fixed landline telephone for all new driving licence applications. The proposed changes, aimed at enhancing road safety and driver competence, have sparked debate. 

The English language test would assess comprehension of road signs and traffic regulations, while the map-reading assessment aims to combat reliance on GPS navigation. The requirement for a fixed landline phone is intended to improve communication in emergencies, particularly in areas with limited mobile reception. 

The consultation period, open until [date], invites public feedback on the proposed changes and their potential impact on accessibility and affordability.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a fixed landline and the chance to book seven days in advance.

"Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him ""significant discomfort"" for months. Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as ""unbelievable"". ""It's very unfortunate,"" said the Frenchman. ""It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again."" Debuchy has played just 14 times since signing from Newcastle in July in a deal worth a reported £12m. With Kieran Gibbs recovering from an inflamed heel, 19-year-old Hector Bellerin or Calum Chambers may deputise against Manchester City on Sunday.

"## Thai Parliament Approves Controversial Amnesty Bill

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sparking protests and raising concerns about the potential for impunity. 

The bill, which aims to reconcile the country after years of political instability, covers a wide range of offences, including those related to the 2010 Red Shirt protests and the 2014 military coup. Critics argue that it would allow for the return of exiled politicians, including Mr Thaksin, and could shield those responsible for human rights abuses. 

Supporters, however, maintain that the amnesty is necessary to move the country forward and bring about national unity. The bill now faces a vote in the Senate, with its fate uncertain.

"## Sunak Accuses Doctors' Union of Spreading ""Misinformation"" 

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced criticism this morning for his handling of the ongoing dispute with the British Medical Association (BMA).  In a heated interview, Sunak accused the BMA of ""playing politics"" and refusing to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" about addressing the current NHS crisis.  He reiterated his offer of a 7% pay increase over the next two years, emphasizing it was the ""fairest and most sustainable"" solution.  However, the BMA insists that this offer falls short of the necessary 30% pay rise to address the years of real-terms pay cuts and the current staffing shortages plaguing the NHS.  The ongoing deadlock threatens further disruption to patient care, with the BMA planning further strikes in the coming months.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave.

"The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The donations were allegedly given in exchange for political support of a controversial merger. Ms Choi has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud.

"## New Dads Still Missing Out on Paternity Leave, Survey Finds

A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than the minimum legally mandated time off. The findings highlight a continued reluctance amongst new dads to prioritize their own wellbeing and the bonding period with their newborns.  

Experts cite a range of factors contributing to this trend, including societal expectations around masculinity, concerns about job security, and inadequate workplace policies. They emphasize the importance of encouraging men to take advantage of paternity leave, arguing that it benefits not only the father, but the entire family and workplace. The survey calls for increased awareness and support for new fathers, urging employers to foster a culture that normalizes and encourages paternity leave.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off Â£49 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened.

"The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, and it was a commercial flop. The game was so poorly received that Atari is said to have buried millions of unsold copies in a landfill in New Mexico. 

The landfill was recently excavated, and the game cartridges were discovered. The discovery has sparked interest in the history of video games, and many people are excited to see what condition the cartridges are in. Some people hope that the cartridges can be sold for a profit, while others hope that they will be donated to museums.

"## Nurses Walk Out in Protest Over Sackings Following Patient Struggle 

The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite colleagues claiming they acted in self-defense. The incident occurred at St. Mary's Hospital on Tuesday, where a patient reportedly became aggressive and violent.  Witnesses say Gregson and Hilton were injured during the struggle, but were later dismissed for allegedly using excessive force. 

The nurses' union, the Royal College of Nursing, has condemned the dismissals, calling them ""unjustified"" and ""unfair."" The union is now calling for an independent investigation into the incident and the subsequent sackings. The walkout, which began at 8am this morning, has caused significant disruption to services at St. Mary's. Patients are being redirected to other hospitals, and elective surgeries have been postponed. It is unclear how long the walkout will continue.

"## Injury Crisis Hits England Back Row Ahead of Crucial Test

England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Ito. The injuries come at a crucial time for the team, who are preparing for their upcoming Test matches. 

Haskell, a veteran of 77 caps, suffered a knee injury during training, while Jones and Williams are recovering from respective hamstring and ankle injuries. Ito, who can play in both the second and back rows, is sidelined with a concussion.

The injuries leave head coach Eddie Jones with a depleted back row, forcing him to look at alternative options for the upcoming fixtures. This setback adds further pressure to an already challenging period for England, who are aiming for a strong performance in the upcoming Test series.

Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargo without guarantees that port fees will be paid. Creditors, banks, and the South Korean government are all reluctant to provide financial aid.

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

"## Japan Approves Historic Legislation Allowing Troops to Fight Abroad

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the upper house, represents a significant shift in Japan's post-war security policy. It would allow the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they could fight alongside allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked.

The legislation has sparked controversy, with some arguing it will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts. Others, however, see it as a necessary step to bolster Japan's security in a rapidly changing regional landscape. The move comes amid growing tensions in the East China Sea, where Japan and China have overlapping territorial claims.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located near the city of Kagoshima, is known for its frequent eruptions, which have intensified in recent years. 

A new study published in the journal ""Nature"" reveals that the volcano's magma chamber is expanding, indicating a potential for larger and more destructive eruptions. Scientists are concerned about the increasing frequency of explosive eruptions, which can send ash plumes high into the atmosphere, disrupting air travel and posing risks to surrounding communities. 

The researchers urge authorities to stay vigilant and implement necessary safety measures to minimize the potential impact of future eruptions.

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the think tank at an event in Manchester today, and examines the disparity in educational attainment between different regions in England.

This was attributed to a number of factors, including better access to high-quality schools, a more diverse range of educational opportunities, and a stronger local economy.

The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber.

Despite the wet weather conditions, tens of thousands of protesters poured out onto the streets demanding that their pacifist constitution be protected and calling for the prime minister to step down.

"##  Thousands of Acorns Planted to Boost Forestry in Galloway

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant thousands of acorns around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to grow about 2,000 new oak trees, bolstering the region's vital forestry sector. This initiative aims to replenish native oak populations, vital for biodiversity and the local economy.

"## Google Assistant Expands Beyond Pixel Phones, Now Available on Samsung Galaxy Devices

Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones.

This move marks a major shift in the voice assistant landscape, opening up a whole new market for Google Assistant.

The Orange Order, which is a Protestant fraternal organization, has announced its intention to comply with the ruling, emphasizing its commitment to peaceful celebrations. The group, however, expressed its concern over the continued restrictions and vowed to continue advocating for the right to march on its traditional route.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.

"##  Rwenzururu King's Medical Privileges Sparks Controversy 

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But the decision to grant him access to a private hospital for treatment has sparked controversy. Critics argue that Mumbere, who is facing charges of treason and murder, should be treated in a public hospital like any other prisoner. 

The government has defended its decision, stating that Mumbere's health condition requires specialized care available only at the designated facility. However, the move has fueled concerns about unequal access to healthcare and potential preferential treatment for high-profile individuals. The debate is expected to intensify as Mumbere's trial continues.

"The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be ""a retrograde step"" and could ""damage the UK's reputation as a welcoming destination for international students."" 

The proposed changes are part of a wider package of measures aimed at tightening immigration controls. The government argues that the stricter requirements are necessary to ensure that only those with a genuine intention to study in the UK are granted visas. However, critics argue that the changes could deter talented students from applying to UK universities.

The impact of these changes on international student numbers remains to be seen. Some experts believe that the stricter requirements could lead to a decline in applications, while others argue that the UK's universities will remain attractive to students from around the world.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead.

"## Newsweek Goes Digital: Print Edition to End After 85 Years

The last print edition of Newsweek will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with The Daily Beast in 2010, and the combined entity will continue to publish online and in mobile formats.

“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, which owns The Daily Beast. “The print advertising market is simply not sustainable for a weekly news magazine.” 

The move marks the end of an era for the iconic magazine, which was founded in 1933 and has won numerous awards for its journalism. However, Newsweek's online presence has grown significantly in recent years, with a strong following on social media. The company hopes to reach a wider audience by focusing on digital platforms.

"Tear gas and live bullets were fired to drive back the mainly Shia Muslim crowds, as they protested against corruption and security failures. Officials imposed a curfew in the Iraqi capital, which has now been lifted. It was the second time this month that protesters had managed to break into the city's government area. Shia Muslim cleric Moqtada Sadr condemned the use of force, and voiced support for the demonstrators' ""peaceful [and] spontaneous revolt"". At least 50 demonstrators are said to have been wounded. The protesters accuse the government of neglecting much-needed reforms, as it struggles with its campaign against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) and declining oil revenues. The Sunni jihadist group controls parts of western and northern Iraq and has been behind a wave of recent attacks that have left dozens killed. Some demonstrators managed to break into the prime minister's office and parliament. Baghdad's Green Zone houses the parliament, key government buildings and many foreign embassies. The authorities later said they had completely regained control of the area and the protesters had withdrawn.

"## Climate Change Costs Could Top $178 Trillion by 2100, New Report Warns

That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) revealed. The report, titled ""The Economic Impacts of Climate Change,"" paints a stark picture of the potential economic devastation wrought by climate change if immediate and drastic action isn't taken.

"## Historic Lyndhurst Park Hotel Facing Demolition for Luxury Flats

The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling and visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson, is facing demolition. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a luxury retirement village, sparking outrage from heritage campaigners. 

The hotel, built in the 18th century, sits in a picturesque location near Lymington, Hampshire. It has been a popular destination for centuries, attracting notable figures such as Stevenson, who stayed there in the 1880s. However, the building has fallen into disrepair and has been empty for several years.

PegasusLife argues that the development will ""provide much-needed housing for the elderly"" and create jobs. However, heritage groups have condemned the plans, calling the hotel ""a vital part of local history"" and urging for its preservation. A public consultation is underway, and the fate of the Lyndhurst Park Hotel remains uncertain.
