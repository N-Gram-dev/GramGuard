""This deadline is not to be missed lightly,"" she warned. ""Every delay raises the risk of these weapons ending up in the wrong hands, with severe consequences."" At the deadline, only about 11% of Syria's chemical arsenal had been removed according to OPCW. The international community is urging Syria to accelerate the process. The delay not only endangers the disarmament effort but also highlights the challenges of eliminating Syria's chemical weapons program amid ongoing civil war."
"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night voting session, further polarizing the already divided nation. 

Opponents of the initiative argue that it is a thinly veiled attempt by the government to whitewash the crimes of exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, allowing him to return without facing corruption charges.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, one of the country's most active, has seen a significant upsurge in activity in recent months, raising concerns among scientists about a potential major eruption. 

The University of Bristol team, in collaboration with colleagues at the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre, have been monitoring the volcano closely. They warn that the current increase in activity could potentially lead to a large-scale eruption, threatening the nearby city of Kagoshima and its 600,000 inhabitants.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging.

"The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition group rejects the proposal, claiming it lacks credibility and is likely to further militarize and complicate the Syrian conflict. 

The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition group, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), voiced strong reservations, stating that the agreement is more likely to freeze the conflict while allowing continued government attacks on opposition-held areas. 

They express their skepticism over the effectiveness of the ""de-escalation zones,"" citing Russia and Iran's track-record of not honoring previous ceasefires. They fear this deal could be an attempt by Moscow to solidify President Bashar al-Assad's control over swathes of Syria.

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the centre-left think tank in Sheffield. The government said extra funds were being given to early years providers to help children from poorer backgrounds and close the attainment gap. The report has also detailed a number of ""tests"" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme.

"Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of a sophisticated benefit fraud scheme, resulting in the embezzlement of over £450,000 of taxpayer’s money. Investigations revealed that the group had submitted fraudulent applications for tax credits and other benefits over a span of five years.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a ""disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum.""

This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities.

Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses.

The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector.

"The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two significant discoveries in the area, has been given the green light to further assess the full potential of its key assets.

This follows the successful drilling of two exploration wells in Senegal, both yielding considerable amounts of hydrocarbon reserves. The study will focus on determining the commercial viability of these resources, which could potentially fortify Senegal's nascent oil industry.

The approval comes as a major boost for Cairn, reinforcing their status as a leading player in the region's burgeoning oil sector. If the evaluation confirms previous estimates, Cairn could be sitting on one of the largest oilfields in West Africa.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all.

Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care.

The survey, which involved over 1,000 participants across various job sectors, reflected a persistent stigma associated with paternity leave. Many new fathers reported feeling pressured to return to work due to concerns about job security, income stability, and perceptions of traditional gender roles.

The findings highlight a need for a paradigm shift in corporate attitudes towards paternity leave. Experts argue that encouraging fathers to take their full leave can have significant benefits, not only for the child's development and the mother's postpartum recovery but also for the overall productivity and morale of employees. It's time for businesses to reassess their policies and culture and contribute proactively to nurturing an equitable workforce.",ai,"A survey of employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave, and fewer than 10% took more than two weeks off to care for their newborns, indicating that workplace cultures and policies may hinder early parental involvement.","According to a survey involving over 1,000 workers, a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave, and less than one in ten took more than two weeks off, suggesting that company policies and culture could be significant obstacles to fathers participating in early childcare.","The survey found that one in four new fathers skipped paternity leave entirely, while fewer than 10% took more than two weeks off to bond with their newborns, highlighting workplace norms and policies as potential barriers to parental involvement.","Results from a survey of employees and managers showed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave, and under 10% took over two weeks off, pointing to workplace culture and policies as key challenges to early father engagement.","A study surveying over 1,000 participants found that a quarter of new fathers avoided taking paternity leave, with less than 10% taking more than two weeks off, suggesting that workplace attitudes and policies may limit fathers' early childcare participation.","The survey involving employees and managers indicated that 25% of new fathers took no paternity leave, and fewer than 10% took more than two weeks off, implying that workplace environments and policies may restrict paternal involvement during early child care.","According to the survey, a quarter of new fathers did not use paternity leave, and fewer than one in ten took more than two weeks off to be with their newborns, which suggests workplace culture and policies might be major barriers to early parental care.","Findings from the survey showed that 25% of new fathers skipped paternity leave, and less than 10% took more than two weeks off, indicating that corporate culture and policies may prevent fathers from engaging in early childcare.","The survey results revealed that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave and fewer than 10% took over two weeks off, highlighting workplace policies and culture as obstacles to fathers’ early involvement in child care.","Over 1,000 participants in a survey reported that 25% of new fathers did not take paternity leave, with fewer than 10% taking more than two weeks off, suggesting workplace cultures and policies pose significant barriers to early paternal engagement."

"The election commission (Inec) said it hoped to announce the winner on Monday. The UN has praised the poll despite technical hitches, protests and violence linked to Boko Haram. Voting spilled into a second day in some parts of Nigeria after problems with new electronic card readers.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.

"Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote in his report that Mr Butler found it ""difficult to control his anger"", which was alarmingly indicative of his pattern of violent behavior. This observation has now resurfaced after Butler was convicted of further violent crimes, highlighting a disappointing failure of the legal and therapeutic systems in managing and averting such cases.

Butler's psychological assessment, made public after recent legal proceedings, underscored the warning signs that were seemingly overlooked. His inability to manage his angry reactions, which led to acts of violence, was not adequately addressed nor were preventive measures put in place.

The case of Ben Butler exposes a larger problem in the system where insufficient attention is given to repeated offenders exhibiting signs of systemic violence. It challenges the efficacy of our rehabilitative measures and prompts a call for more proactive action in managing violent individuals. The system's ability to protect citizens from repeat offenders remains under scrutiny.",ai,"In 2004, Ben Butler encountered a psychologist following an assault incident at a nightclub.

"Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had ""fragile"" staffing levels and needed to ""implement more robust human resource strategies.""

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has issued a stark warning about frailty in police staffing levels, stating that the force currently operates with ""fragile"" staffing levels and needs to ""implement more robust human resource strategies."" This recent assessment has thrown light on the intensifying pressure faced by law enforcement agencies around the country, which are grappling with budget cuts and rising crime rates.

HMIC emphasized that higher quality leadership and management, coupled with the implementation of a more strategic workforce plan, can help to stave off the staffing crisis.

Public safety is potentially at risk if these concerns are not addressed promptly.

"Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to restore and revitalize the native woodland environment. 

The initiative, supported by the Scottish Natural Heritage, aims to combat the continuous deforestation that has plagued the country and foster a more sustainable ecology. Rehabilitation of the woodland through planting acorns will bring back the natural biodiversity that once thrived in these areas.

Not only will the project aid in environmental recuperation, but it will also provide a habitat for local wildlife, particularly endangered species who rely on the forest ecosystem for survival. It is expected that the reforestation will attract a range of fauna, from birds to mammals, contributing to a more balanced ecosystem.

Furthermore, the initiative will provide an educational opportunity for the local community, allowing them to engage with nature in a meaningful and hands-on way.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University and AkzoNobel. 

The Port Talbot-based Specific Innovation Centre is working on the revolutionary concept of ""buildings as power stations"". An ambitious project, it is a collaborative effort involving Tata Steel, Swansea University and AkzoNobel, aiming to create a sustainable future for the construction industry.

At its core, the project aims to develop buildings that can generate, store, and release their own solar energy. This innovative approach to energy production and consumption could transform the way we perceive and use buildings.

Tata Steel provides the building materials, Swansea University brings its expertise in solar energy research, while AkzoNobel, a global paint and coatings company, ensures the buildings are not only energy efficient but aesthetically pleasing as well.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 4.9%, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This static rate reflects the stability in the UK job market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. 

The numbers signify that the UK economy continues to display resilience, maintaining a relatively low level of unemployment. Economists have noted the robustness of the job market, attributing it to a combination of flexible working arrangements and sustained consumer spending. 

However, experts have also pointed out that while the overall unemployment figures are positive, they do not explicitly reflect the quality of work available. Underemployment and the prevalence of zero-hour contracts are ongoing issues, which the headline figures fail to address.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy owners to potentially evade tax obligations. 

The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to potentially dodge tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly leading the probe, which could hold significant implications for global finance. 

Bearer bonds, which were outlawed in the US in 1982 due to their use in money laundering and tax evasion, are still legal in other countries, including Switzerland. Critics argue that these unregistered securities are a loophole in tax law that primarily benefits the ultra-wealthy. 

The investigation comes amid increased efforts by US authorities to crack down on offshore tax evasion.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been identified in a recent research study conducted by the College of Policing. The findings suggest that officers were primarily focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other significant risk factors. This bias towards violent offences may be compromising the efficacy of policing in these areas, potentially leaving citizens vulnerable to other types of crime.

The research highlighted the need for deeper insights and broader scopes in threat assessments to ensure comprehensive law enforcement. The three unnamed police forces have reportedly taken the findings on board and are now reassessing their approaches to address this issue.

The findings also urge for improved training and resource allocation, particularly for areas of crime that may not involve violence but are equally detrimental, such as cybercrime, fraud, and drug offenses.

The agency advised ignoring all tweets until further notice. The fake message caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to drop 150 points as it was retweeted. The FBI said Tuesday night it was investigating the hack. White House spokesman Jay Carney assured the public President Obama was unharmed, and markets quickly regained lost ground. AP later confirmed its Twitter account had been hacked and the tweet was false. The account was restored on Wednesday. The attack followed repeated hacker attempts to steal AP journalists’ passwords, and the agency is working to fix the problem.

"The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies.

According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients.

The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS.

"PC Frances Tilley admitted she had ""destroyed her career"" after evading payment for a journey between Bristol Temple Meads station and Castle Cary. The incident, which took place last year, has come to light this week after a disciplinary hearing found her guilty of gross misconduct.

Tilley, a police officer with over ten years of service, confessed to travelling without a valid ticket and subsequently providing false information during the formal investigation. This incident has resulted in her dismissal from the Avon and Somerset Police Department.

The panel, chaired by independent legal adviser, Jane Jones, concluded that Tilley's actions were deliberate and constituted a serious breach of the Standards of Professional Behaviour. The decision to dismiss her was unanimous, reflecting the severity of her misconduct. 

In a statement, Tilley expressed remorse for her actions and acknowledged the self-inflicted end of her career. The incident serves as a crucial reminder that police officers, like all individuals, are expected to uphold the law at all times.

The new charity will still be called English Heritage and the 420 sites in the National Heritage Collection - which include London's Kenwood House, and Charles Darwin's home in Kent - will remain in public ownership. Government funding for the charity will be tapered down from 2015 eventually to nothing, meaning it will have more freedom than now to generate income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations. Some of the £80m awarded by the government will help to set up the charity so it will be fully operational by",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
"Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there were increasing concerns about the number of Australian teenagers being radicalized and trying to join extremist groups overseas. The 17-year-old, whose identity has been withheld due to privacy laws, was stopped under Operation Rampart, a joint initiative by the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, aimed at identifying and deterring individuals from travelling overseas to participate in hostile activities. 

Mr. Dutton warned that extremist groups were actively targeting vulnerable young Australians online, leveraging their sense of isolation or grievances to push radical ideologies. The incident underscores the ongoing threat of homegrown extremism, in a country that has largely been insulated from the global scourge of terrorism.

The Minister urged parents and guardians to keep a vigilant eye on the online activities of their children, raising awareness of the risks associated with radicalisation.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but recent developments have urged a reconsideration of the case. The Mcleod family has long suspected foul play, alleging a cover-up by the local police force.

The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) has now decided to reopen the case, following numerous appeals by the family and the emergence of new evidence. A fresh autopsy report suggests that Mcleod could have suffered internal injuries before drowning, contradicting the initial findings of accidental death by drowning.

The Mcleod family's relentless pursuit for justice and the new autopsy findings have sparked a nationwide conversation about accountability and transparency in law enforcement agencies.

The SPA has expressed its commitment to a comprehensive review of the case. They hope their efforts will provide the family with the answers they have sought for over two decades and potentially bring to light any misconduct or negligence that may have occurred.

"As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast during the upcoming annual 12th July demonstrations.

"The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used to transfer various interfaces onto tabletops, walls, or even your own hand. 

This groundbreaking technology is paving the way for a new era of interactivity, propelling us towards a future where physical devices may become obsolete. The practical applications are endless, from providing musicians with portable, easily customizable instruments to offering a more immersive and flexible workspace for professionals.

The laser projector works by emitting a grid of infrared beams. When the user interacts with the projected interface, the beams are interrupted, and the system can calculate the exact location of the interaction. For instance, each faux piano key or button pressed on a projected keyboard can correspond to a specific note or command.

"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the region. The regulation has stirred international controversy, with human rights advocates voicing their concerns over the potential infringement on individual religious freedoms. 

The local government in Urumqi, the capital city of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has argued that the ban seeks to counteract extremism and maintain social harmony.
