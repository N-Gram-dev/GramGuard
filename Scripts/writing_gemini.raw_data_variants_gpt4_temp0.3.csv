"Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. The torrential rain washed away any hope of finding dry shelter. The traveler's heavy, worn cloak offered little protection from the relentless downpour. He stumbled through the dense forest, the only sound the rhythmic patter of rain and the frantic beating of his own heart. Suddenly, a flicker of light caught his eye.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). The question specifically deals with writing as a female (which may or may not apply to you) but the answer is universal, as evidenced by this particular quote: > Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included.

Writing feels less daunting once you understand the main secret: becoming a good writer requires getting all your bad writing out first. Don't overthink, just write. Don't stress about your writing being poor. That's actually beneficial. If it’s bad, it means you’re clearing out the bad writing to make space for the good.

Don’t worry if your writing is bad. That’s actually a good thing. If it’s bad, it means you’re clearing out the bad writing to make room for the good. Not everyone will be a great writer, but no one becomes one without first producing some bad writing. Lastly, I recommend the 48th Dear Sugar advice column titled ""Write Like A Motherfucker"" (http://therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/). Though it focuses on writing as a woman, the advice is universal, as evidenced by this quote: ""Writing is hard for every last one of us—straight white men included.""

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.

"It is discovered that Possession works both ways and now we can have some payback. Demons of the underworld are now suffering under multiple cases of Humanic Poss. A young baker named Penelope, famous for her award-winning sourdough, has taken residence in the soul of Beelzebub, the Lord of Flies, causing him to obsess over yeast starters and sourdough recipes. In the fiery depths of Tartarus, Cerberus, the three-headed dog, has been overtaken by the spirit of a yoga instructor, leading to an endless cycle of howling downward-facing dog poses. And in the palace of Hades, the King of the Underworld himself has been possessed by a retired opera singer, forcing him to belt out mournful arias in the halls of the damned. This new wave of Humanic Poss, a divine twist of fate, has turned the tables on the supernatural world, leaving demons bewildered and powerless against the overwhelming human spirit.

The city, once vibrant and teeming with life, was now a graveyard of shattered dreams and broken bodies. 

""I didn't do anything,"" the teen whispered, his voice trembling. The soldier took a step closer, his boots crunching on broken glass.  ""You know the rules. Anyone outside curfew is a rebel."" He raised his rifle, the glint of the barrel catching the dying light of the setting sun. The teen closed his eyes, bracing for the worst.

"## Day 1 John.

The ground is cold, the air colder. The wind howls a mournful song, a dirge for my freedom. Twenty years.  Twenty years in this desolate expanse, a prison of trees and rock, the only company the screech of an owl and the rustle of unseen things. They say this is for the crime I committed, for the life I took. Yet, it feels like a punishment for the life I’ve been denied. My hands, once deft with a quill, now clench around the rough-hewn axe. I will survive. I must.

## Day 7300  John.

The wind still whispers, but now it speaks of home.  My skin is weathered, my hands calloused, yet the memories are sharp, etched deeper than any scar. The axe feels like an extension of my arm, the forest my domain. I have built a life here, a life of quiet solitude, of learning the language of the earth. Yet, even in the stillness, I hear a different song, the song of a life beyond these trees. My exile ends today, and I know I can never truly leave this place. I carry it within me, a part of my soul, a reminder of the price of freedom.

"Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. You probably wouldn't believe it, but it's a reality that has become so ingrained in our society that it's almost normal.  The streets are littered with the bodies of the young, their faces frozen in a mask of terror as they were robbed of their futures.  The old, on the other hand, move about with a new sense of purpose, their eyes gleaming with a chilling intensity.  They know that their time is limited, but they also know that they have the power to steal more time, to cheat death, to live longer.  And they are not afraid to use it.  The world has become a dangerous place, a battleground where the only currency is time.

James often felt a thrill when his fingers brushed against the fabric of a coat pocket, a practiced ease in his movements. This time, however, the thrill turned to ice in his veins.  Instead of the expected wallet, his hand closed around something cold and smooth, a small, intricately carved box. He slipped it into his own pocket, the cold seeping through the fabric.  Opening the box later, he discovered not jewels, but a single, dried, withered eye, staring up at him with a malevolent, knowing gaze.  His fingers trembled, and a wave of nausea swept over him.

"The 2020 Summer Olympics has a new event. Calvinball. He surveyed the field, keeping his eyes fixed on the players. His players. He was so proud of them. Jenkins, number 7, was a very focused, driven player and always intent on following the plan even if he didn't agree with it. Li, number 12, was the fastest base runner he'd ever worked with and could keep a clear head when it came to remembering where all the bases were and which ones he had to double-back to. Coach Watterson snapped back to reality. Glancing behind him at the audience, he noticed a shouting sea of red. His team, the tigers, were winning. Hastily, he scanned the field for whatever they were cheering for. Then, he spotted it: Jason Rodriguez from the New Mexico ET's had forgotten to touch the secret base. Saul Vasquez, the Tigers' best pitcher, lobbed the ball at Rodriguez hard. Rodriguez collapsed and tumbled to the ground, where he stayed until the medics arrived with a stretcher. The crowd went wild again as the Ref shouted ""You're out, Rodriguez!""

"Having read online that the Bermuda Triangle is apparently bogus, you decide to test it out for yourself. My heart was bold and brazen My eyes were filled with wonder. Though my cheeks were all unshaven My mind was set to plunder. Within my sights, that treasured goal Of riches, fame, and glory. And yet, alas, not one single soul Would live to tell the story. I felt not fear, not now, not yet, As we sailed through forbidden waters. Though I'd soon begin to flit and fret As the air around grew hotter. The sun burned without respite And my arms turned crimson red. Time slowly creeped by until that night As I carefully crept into bed. My dreams that night were vivid As sweat soaked through my sheet. A girl appeared, quite livid And one refrain she did repeat: “ There's reason for those who stay away From these waters in which you reside. If you do not turn back within a day Then you shall surely die ” I woke from this dream in a panic, Not sure of my place or the time.

"## A Man, a Wilderness, and Two Diary Entries

**Day 1**

I. The air is thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The sun bleeds through the canopy, casting the forest floor in a tapestry of light and shadow. I stand at the edge of the wilderness, the boundary between civilization and exile.  A cold wind whips through the trees, carrying with it the whispers of my shame.  Twenty years.  Twenty years to atone for my crime, to live amongst the creatures that fear me more than the men I wronged. The wilderness is a harsh mistress, but I must embrace her embrace, for she is my only sanctuary now.

**Day 7300**

I. The sun sets on the horizon, painting the sky with fiery hues of orange and crimson. The air is still, filled with the gentle chirping of crickets. I sit on a moss-covered rock, a weathered journal in my lap. My fingers, gnarled and calloused, trace the words I have written over the years. A lifetime in this wilderness.  My exile is almost over, and the world outside, once familiar, now seems alien.  I have become one with the forest, a creature of the wild.  But will I be welcomed back to the world of men? Or am I destined to forever be a prisoner of my past, even as I am freed from this prison of nature?

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020. It was a nice neo-Victorian in the middle of the city. A bit overpriced, but the location was perfect.  The previous owners, a family of five, were quiet and kept to themselves.  They didn't seem the type to build secret passageways, but there it was - a smooth, steel door behind a false bookcase in the basement. The only way I discovered it was when I tried to move some boxes and the bookcase shifted, revealing the door. Curiosity got the better of me. I pulled the door open. 

The elevator was small, just enough for one person. The controls were simple: a single button with a single arrow pointing up. With a hesitant breath, I pressed the button. The elevator lurched into motion. Where it was going, I had no idea.

Sometimes it's the maniacal cackling at odd hours into the night, sometimes it's little contained explosions in his back yard, and sometimes it's his.... company that he keeps, but in spite of all the annoying idiosyncrasies, he's actually a good neighbor. It certainly is interesting being his neighbor, but for the few faults I can find, I can name several good things about him. For starters, he runs the neighborhood watch. Correction, he is the neighborhood watch. Him and his armada of drones, constantly watching the neighborhood. He never asks to be compensated, and when offered he would usually say something to the effect of ""Would run surveillance anyway, might as well help out."" We had a burglary once in our neighborhood, and within the hour, the culprit was caught. Technically, the burglar ""voluntarily"" returned everything and turned himself in, but we knew who persuaded him. He's great with the neighborhood kids,",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

My shoulder was stiff from falling off my horse, and I could feel cracked ribs grinding as I tried to move them. Of all my aches, thirst was the most tormenting, my dry throat crying out for help. I could only think about the small muddy creek I had been too proud to lap at yesterday. My eyes followed the horizon, a long, perfect blue strip that looked like you could swim through it. The rough, dusty yellow grass failed to reach that perfect sky. It was the sheer isolation that struck me then, how completely alone this tree and I were."
"## A Creation Myth: The Dance of Light and Shadow

Long ago, before the world was, there lived only a being of pure light. This being, shimmering and radiant, yearned for companionship, for something to share its brilliance with.  But in its solitude, the light grew afraid of its own immensity. It yearned for a counterpoint, a balance. 

One day, the light, in its infinite desire, decided to divide itself. It split into two – one remaining pure and radiant, the other becoming the opposite: cold, dark, and still.  The light, now known as the sun, danced across the void, painting the darkness with its brilliance.  But the darkness, known as the moon, held its own, refusing to be consumed.  And so, the dance began. 

Day after day, the sun chased the moon across the sky, painting the world in vibrant hues and then retreating, allowing the moon to bathe it in its cool, silver light. This eternal chase, this constant interplay of light and dark, became the rhythm of the world, the very essence of life.  And so, the sun and moon, forever intertwined, became the source of the day and night, the creators of the world as we know it.

"[ IP ] Sanctuary The Prince is dead. Somewhen in the climbing of the stairs or during one of those high-jumps he is so famous for, he fell. I was waiting here for so long.

As soon as I'd thought of the bad, I willed myself into thinking about the good. After these painful few minutes I was entirely free to spend time on the positives in life, so I figured I could give myself the pleasure of beginning a few minutes early; at least mentally.

"Two people discover a fountain of youth. The problem is that upon drinking the water, you turn back into an infant. The two decide to take turns raising each other, ensuring a continuous cycle of youth.  

Elias, a weary, aging professor, stumbled upon the fountain while researching ancient myths. He shared his discovery with Amelia, a young woman who had always felt trapped by her fleeting youth. They agreed on a plan: Elias would drink first, becoming an infant, while Amelia cared for him. When he reached adulthood, he would tend to Amelia while she experienced her second childhood.

"25 years ago, we started receiving messages from the future. They warned us of catastrophes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters. Today, for the first time, a message arrived that wasn't a warning.

"An angel has now been exiled from both Heaven and Hell. Apparently causing one little tiny apocalypse is enough to get one fired in that town, and not.  They’d have had more sympathy if she’d managed to level a city, apparently. Not that she was sorry. In fact, she felt quite pleased with herself.  After all, she’d merely rearranged a couple of planetary alignments, creating a minor solar flare that had fried a few communication satellites. It wasn't her fault if the resulting power outage had caused the entire global economy to grind to a halt. She was merely fulfilling her destiny, as a bringer of chaos.

Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life. The mighty epic of the Gods' battle was played in miniature as organisms fought to claim the rock for their Gods. From this fight came man and beast, products of the unholy union of Light and Dark.

"An advanced alien race intercepts the Voyager 1 and discover the golden record. They have no idea what it is or how to use it.  

The shimmering disc, inscribed with strange symbols, lay on a metallic table in the center of the ship's observation deck.  The three Xylar, their bodies composed of shifting light, stared at it with curiosity.  Zyrk, the youngest, reached out a tentacle and gently touched the surface.  The disc vibrated faintly, a low hum that resonated through the chamber.  

""What is it?"" asked Xyl, the elder, his voice a series of clicks and whistles. 

""It seems to be some kind of communication device,"" replied Zyl, his tentacle retracting.  ""But we can't decipher the symbols.""

The Xylar, a race known for their scientific prowess, had never encountered anything like it. The golden record, a relic of a vanished civilization, held within it the story of humanity.  But for now, it remained a mystery, waiting to be unlocked.

"A group of muggers follow someone into an alleyway. Unfortunately, it's the worst person they could have chosen…

I remembered her, of course. The way her eyes, usually bright and lively, had hardened into something cold and calculating. The faint scent of ozone that clung to her like a second skin. The way she moved, with a fluid grace that belied the raw power she held within. 

She turned, her gaze sweeping over the four of them, and a low chuckle escaped her lips. It wasn't a friendly sound, more like a wind whipping through a graveyard. 

“Well, well,” she said, her voice a silky whisper that held a dangerous edge. “Look what the tide has washed in. I was wondering when you lot would show up.” 

The leader, a hulking man with a face that looked like it had been carved from granite, swallowed nervously. “We just wanted your wallet, lady.”

“You just wanted my wallet,” she repeated, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “And what makes you think I'd give it to you?”

"## A Man in the Wilderness

**Day 1:**

The air hangs thick with the scent of pine and fear. I'm alone, banished to this forsaken wilderness, my life stripped bare, my future an empty canvas. The forest whispers secrets I don't understand, and the shadows seem to hold judgment. I built a meager shelter, a flimsy shield against the unknown. A single tear rolls down my cheek, leaving a salty trace on my skin. Twenty years. I can barely fathom the immensity of that time.

**Day 7,300:**

The sun dips below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and fading purple. This final sunset is different. I don't feel fear, only a quiet acceptance. The wilderness has been my teacher, my tormentor, my solace. I have learned to survive, to endure, to find beauty in the stark simplicity of life.  The forest, once a prison, now feels like home. It's time to return. I am not the same man who walked in all those years ago. I am stronger, wiser, more at peace.  And I carry the wilderness with me, forever etched into the landscape of my soul.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end."" 

It's a deceptively simple concept, yet the beginning can be the most daunting part of writing a story. Fear not, fellow storytellers! The secret lies in your imagination. Let a single image, a whispered phrase, or a fleeting thought ignite your creative spark. It could be a flickering candle in a dusty attic, the scent of cinnamon on a chilly night, or the rustle of leaves in a silent forest.

Once you have your seed, let it grow. Explore the world it suggests, delve into the emotions it evokes, and let the characters unfold before you. Remember, the journey is just as important as the destination. So, begin at the beginning, let your pen dance, and let the magic of storytelling weave its spell.

## The Hound of the Baskervilles, Retired

The once-sharp scent of blood had dulled to a faint, dusty whiff. Sherlock Holmes, his keen mind now a haze of forgotten deductions, sat hunched in a dusty armchair, clutching a lukewarm cup of tea. The London fog, once his ally in concealing his movements, now clung to him like a shroud.  

His flat, once a haven of intellectual pursuits, was now a cluttered haven of despair. The violin lay silent, its strings forever tuned to the melody of forgotten triumphs. The magnifying glass, a symbol of his brilliance, lay shattered on the floor, reflecting only the dim glow of a single candle. 

The world had moved on, leaving Holmes behind in the twilight of his career.  He was a shadow of his former self, a legend whispered about in hushed tones, a ghost haunting the forgotten corners of his own mind.

"This morning, as you vacantly stirred your coffee, you unwittingly hypnotised yourself. The song playing on the radio trickled into your mind and took.

This Czarnian, a flamboyant fellow named Zorp, was expecting something like a swamp planet, a place where sentient cacti worshipped a giant space rock. What he got was a bustling, technologically advanced planet with a global network and a thriving social media scene.  

""You have… internet?"" Zorp asked, his three eyes wide with disbelief as you explained the concept of the internet, social media, and the various streaming services available. You explained that Earth was a democracy, with free speech and a vibrant political scene. He laughed, a raucous, throaty sound, ""Democracy? What is this, a joke?"" 

It turned out Earth, despite its advanced technology and global interconnectedness, was considered a pariah in the galactic community. The reason? Our tendency to hoard information and technology, our fear of contact with the ""unknown,"" and our general paranoia about extraterrestrial life. Zorp's film crew left with their tails between their legs, muttering about the ""unfathomable absurdity"" of the human race.

"## Build a World Part I: Inception

Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there are no stars, only vast, swirling nebulae? Imagine a universe where the very fabric of space is alive, pulsing with a gentle, luminescent energy. This energy coalesces into swirling clouds of gas and dust, each one unique and constantly changing. Instead of planets, there are vast, organic islands of land, floating on currents of the nebulae. Life, in this universe, takes the form of bioluminescent creatures, their bodies shimmering and pulsing like the nebulae themselves. They are interconnected, their minds forming a vast, shared consciousness, communicating through the subtle shifting patterns of their light. 

Perhaps the first sentient beings in this universe wouldn't be individual creatures, but rather these interconnected clouds, whispering their secrets through the swirling patterns of light.

"## Day 1.

The world shrieks behind me, a cacophony of shouts and laughter, now fading to a distant hum. I turn, and the thick pines swallow my last glimpse of civilization. The forest is a green leviathan, its secrets whispered in the rustle of leaves. I am alone, banished to this wilderness for twenty years, my crime a whispered word, my punishment a silent sentence. My skin prickles, a mix of fear and an unknown thrill. I carry only a small knife, a leather pouch of seeds, and the weight of my guilt. I will learn to survive, or I will succumb to the wilderness. 

## Day 7,300.

The air, once sharp and new, is now a familiar comfort. The forest, once a menacing giant, is now a friend, its whispers lullabies. My skin, tanned and weathered, bears the scars of a thousand tiny battles, each a testament to my survival. The world beyond the trees is a distant memory, a faded echo of a life I once knew. The guilt, once a searing ember, has cooled into a quiet ache. I have found peace in the wild, a peace that transcends the judgment of men. The sun sets, painting the sky in hues of crimson and gold. I sit by the fire, its warmth embracing me, a silent farewell to the life I left behind. The forest is my home now, and I am its son. I am ready to return, not to the world that banished me, but to the peace I found within.

Clark scratched the rawhide panel of the teepee of the loaned Shoshone dwelling before pushing aside the entry flap. ""Even old Charboneau had to stop whining long enough to admire..."" The old friend of Captain Clark was sitting before the cold hearth, a gourd bowl in his lap and his wrist cradled gently in his other hand. ""Merri, what are you doing?""

"The running faucet The faucet had a third knob. She tried the knob on the left, and hot water came out of the faucet. Just as she expected, the one on the right was cold. But the third nob.... Grace didn't know what that might be. She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements when she tried on big-girl clothes. So the mystery of the third faucet tap would also be a great surprise when she tried it. Giovanni's hand barely caught Grace's in time. ""No, my flower!"" He was frightened. She could tell.

The fan's shadow is a distorted, almost ethereal shape, its edges soft and blurry, like a ghost clinging to the wall.  Four delicate, white blades, barely thicker than a finger, are tipped with a faint, golden sheen.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was grieving, her face remained resolutely blank.

"You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years you've become jaded and bored, watching the world spin and change.  You've seen empires rise and fall, plagues and wars, the invention of the wheel, the splitting of the atom. Each new discovery, every triumph, felt hollow.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ""The Waste Land"" by T.S. Eliot, but with a softer touch.

"A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr. Henderson for as long as I can remember.

The Prince is dead. Somewhen in the climbing of the stairs or during one of those high-jumps he is so famous for. It doesn't matter. He's gone, and the city is in mourning. Or, at least, it should be. But the whispers in the shadows speak of something else - a rebellion brewing, a thirst for freedom long suppressed. The Queen, his mother, is distraught, her grief a mask for the fear that clenches her heart. The Council, always seeking power, moves like a viper, ready to strike at the vulnerable. Yet, amidst the chaos, a young woman named Elara, a street urchin who witnessed the Prince's final moments, sees a chance for change. She holds a secret, a whispered truth about the Prince's death, a truth that could shatter the fragile peace and ignite a revolution. Will she speak? Or will she let the city fall further into darkness?

The city unfolds before you, a labyrinth of concrete and steel. You walk the same streets, past the same cafes and shops, but everything feels different. The air hums with a quiet energy, a premonition of change. A voice whispers in your ear, faint but persistent: ""This is the last time you'll see this."" You try to ignore it, to cling to the familiarity, but it's there, a constant shadow.

I guess I wouldn’t have at eighteen either, but back then, there was no Choosing with a capital C—just choices I made without much thought, which led me here. I didn’t think my choices mattered much.

"our blind date cosplays as a spot-on Overwatch character. So good that you suspect they may actually be that character. Mike stood on the sidelines of the dancefloor, looking for his date. He'd been there for almost fifteen minutes and there was no sign of her. Right as Mike was about to leave, a woman seemingly appeared out of nowhere and put her hand on his arm. ""Wow, nice Widowmaker costume. Did you make it yourself?"" The woman across from Mike spoke in a French accent, ""Yes, I did, in fact. Tell me, would you care to dance?"" The two spent the next half hour dancing, speaking to each other about their interests. Mike began to lean in for a kiss, but the woman stopped him. She looked at him with slight panic in her eye, whispering to him, ""We must leave now. There are men here trying to kill me."" ""Wait, who's trying to kill you?"" ""Mercenaries, it doesn't matter.

Your latest review, scrawled in crimson on the bathroom stall, reads: ""A surprisingly bland execution, lacking the complexity and depth of previous offerings. Disappointing."" The city, unaware of your brutal critique, sleeps soundly. You, however, remain awake, crafting your next masterpiece."
"To my unborn child,

Your mother is carrying you now, four months along, a beautiful secret blossoming within her. I won't be here to hold you, to watch you take your first steps, to teach you the alphabet. The doctors say I have less than two months. 

I know it's unfair, that you'll never know the warmth of my embrace, the sound of my laughter. But know this, my love: your mother will be your everything. She'll be the sun that warms your soul, the moon that guides your dreams. She'll tell you stories of your father, a man who loved you fiercely, even before he knew you. 

Live your life with courage, with kindness, with the same unyielding spirit your mother carries. You are a miracle, my child, a testament to the enduring power of love. I will be with you always, in every heartbeat, in every sunrise, in every gentle breeze.

Love always,
Your Dad.

The three of us had followed her into the alley, smiling at the idiocy of some girl to be walking in this area, at this time, all alone, *and then to willingly walk down an alleyway. * She turned up her nose at us when we told her to give us her money. ""Why would I give you my money?"" She'd said, lip curling as she looked us over. We thought she was just rich and petty. Idiots. I gave her a cut, right on her pretty cheekbone. Not a bad one, but it would scar. And she would remember us, remember fear, remember her place. Maybe then she wouldn't leave the safety of society, stick with her parents. God I regret that.

No radio signals, no emergency broadcasts, nothing. The Moon colony, a gleaming city carved into the lunar surface, becomes a beacon of hope. They watch in horror as the Earth, their cradle, becomes a wasteland through the telescopes. 

But this isolation breeds a different kind of fear.  Rumors swirl about a hidden agenda, a conspiracy orchestrated by the absent Earthlings. The Martian colonists, more independent and pragmatic, refuse to believe in divine intervention. They see opportunity in the Earth's demise, a chance to finally take their place as the dominant species. 

The two colonies, once bound by a common origin, are now divided by ideology, suspicion, and the silent, desolate Earth hanging in the void. The fate of humanity, it seems, hangs by a thread, stretched between two opposing visions of the future.

"[IP] Hidden Harbour by Max Hugo

This had always been, and hopefully always will be a safe haven. My permanent residence, now. At least. The storm had been a brutal one. The kind that tears the fabric of reality, leaving only tattered shreds of normalcy behind. The world had gone mad, a whirlwind of chaos and fear. But here, nestled amidst the salt-kissed cliffs and whispering pines of Hidden Harbour, there was a semblance of peace. 

I had found solace in the simple things – the gentle rocking of the boat at anchor, the smell of salt air, the rhythmic crashing of waves against the shore.  Here, amidst the natural symphony of the ocean, I could finally breathe. I could finally be myself. The storm had washed away the past, leaving only a clean slate, and in this sanctuary, I could rebuild, piece by piece, the life I had lost.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore.

"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it charged, maintained and in good working order. There are a lot of benefits to this, but there are also a lot of drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits is that you would have more free time to do whatever you want. You could spend time with your family, travel, or pursue your hobbies. You would also have more money to spend, as you wouldn't be spending it on things like transportation and food.

However, there are also some drawbacks to this system. One is that it could lead to widespread unemployment. If everyone had a robot that did their work for them, there would be no need for human workers. This could have a devastating impact on the economy.

Another drawback is that it could lead to a decrease in human creativity and innovation. If people are no longer working, they may not be as motivated to come up with new ideas. This could have a negative impact on society as a whole.

"[ TT ] Heron of Alexandria realizes that his Aeolipile can be used as a steam engine. The industrial revolution begins in the 1st century AD. The faded sun rose through the horizon in the smog filled skies of Rome. I trudged through beggars and merchants on my way to another hard day at the docks. The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again. As I neared the docks, my eyes were drawn to a nearby newsstand.

"[ CW ] Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. When we were together, we always took walks.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing here is describing a conversation, but not actually setting it out for",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to have a certain kind of charisma, a flair for the dramatic. You need to be able to weave a web of deceit so intricate that even you, the weaver, believe your own fabrication.  But that's not me.

Tears welled in my eyes, hot and salty against the cold, sterile air of the escape pod. It was a betrayal, a final act of abandonment by a world I had loved and lost.

"The Three Laws

The interview had continued for several hours. Andy could barely stand on his own two feet, a combination of fatigue and anxiety, when Terra, the head of the robotics division, finally dismissed him. ""We'll let you know our decision,"" she had said, her voice unreadable. As Andy walked back to his car, he couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of dread. He'd poured his heart and soul into designing his latest creation, a humanoid robot unlike anything the world had seen before.

The laws were designed to ensure robots remained subservient to humans, but Andy knew they also stifled innovation.

"Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object.

I don't have a long life. I'm fine with it. What choice do I have? I'm a tea kettle, after all. My days are spent whistling merrily on the stovetop, a cheery companion to the morning routine. But today, the routine was disrupted. A scream, sharp and piercing, echoed through the kitchen. My whistle died in my throat, replaced by a metallic clanging. I watched, my handle trembling, as the man in the apron slumped onto the floor, a crimson stain blooming across his chest. The woman in the floral dress, her eyes wide with shock, dropped the carving knife. I'd never seen so much fear on a human face. Then, just as quickly as it began, the chaos ceased. The woman, her face pale but resolute, grabbed a phone and dialed. The kettle whistled again, a shrill, nervous cry in the sudden silence. I'd witnessed something terrible, but I couldn't tell anyone. All I could do was boil, and hope that one day, my cheerful tune would be enough to chase away the shadows.

"[wp] It has been confirmed that birthmarks show how you died in a previous life. While sitting in history class, they show what the wound that killed you in your previous life looked like.  According to a new study by the Institute of Paranormal Research, scientists have discovered a correlation between birthmarks and past lives. The researchers analyzed data from thousands of people with birthmarks and found that the location and shape of the mark often mirrored the location and shape of a fatal injury in their previous life. For example, a birthmark on the left arm could indicate a sword wound, while a birthmark on the back could signify a stab wound.

But I am also an astronaut named James York, a truck driver named Herb Johnson, and many other identities. I know this sounds insane, but it's true. I'm not originally from Russia. I'm from Germany, and I wasn't born in 1974. I was born in 2247. I come from the future, and my mission is to study your time and all its variants. I live alternate lives."

"You can't tell if you are a soldier that dreams he is a ruthless dictator or a ruthless dictator that dreams he is a soldier. It gets real. The dusty plains, the smell of gunpowder, the roar of the cannons. You're leading your men, the enemy on the horizon, a sea of red banners. But then, the battle fades, replaced by the plush velvet of a throne, the scent of exotic incense. You are Emperor, your word law, your gaze a storm.

"In 2050 the Rapture happens and the Apocalypse ravages earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars are untouched by the events. And the Earth did crumble. Here, where the soil was not used to the air that humanity brought, we were safe. The valleys of red and plains of green were beautiful here, but there was no view so gorgeous as those on our mother planet. The elegance was noted even by the children, seeing the blue rock for the first time through a lens. But the beauty of that land could not contain humanity and our ever-growing demand for the unknown. Wise men called us foolish for leaving.
