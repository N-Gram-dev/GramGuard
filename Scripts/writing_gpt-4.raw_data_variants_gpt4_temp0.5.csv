"A team of Extra Terrestrial scientists reach Earth, which they deemed ""potentially habitable"" from their planet, and are astonished by their findings. Making their way through dense vegetation and bustling cities, they discover a civilization living in harmony with nature and technology, a concept they had only theorized. The Earth's diverse biosphere, teeming with a plethora of species, greatly exceeds their expectations. They witness the human race, their complex emotions, their capacity to love, hate, create, and destroy, all of which are unparalleled phenomena. The team marvels at the Earth's immense blue oceans and towering mountains, sights never before seen in their homogenous world of ice. The existence of music, art and literature, they find particularly intriguing. These alien scientists leave with a new appreciation for life, contemplating the idea that their ""potentially habitable"" planet was, in fact, teeming with a unique, vibrant civilization that they were yet to understand fully.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 1, 1645h: They say people learn to live when they're forced to. Well, here I am, forced to learn in the most brutal way possible. I can't bring myself to kill anything for food. I've read about people training animals to bring them food.... Might be worth a shot. This might be my first and final entry. Wish my luck, stranger. _______________________________________ Year 20, 1540h (Last day): It's down to the last hour now. My pack stands strong, their howls churning the blood of the unworthy. I don't think I want to go back now, now that I've lived with such majestic creatures. Animals never kill for pleasure. They don't leave the weak, sick or old behind. Hierarchies are obeyed and troublemakers are kicked out, but not killed. This is a good society. A noble one.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Allah is great and has a place in His kingdom for all men of the book. We fled south, my father leading our broken nation to the lands given by Morocco. He knew we would have to rebuild again.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses.

"Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her arms wrapped around her shins locking them firmly in place as she shook quietly. Jenny's room was nearly empty, all that remained were some old chests, dressers and the bare bed on which she curled. In a large cardboard box, the kind that sagged along the bottom with crinkled corners, thick tape all around and sharpie on the sides were all her earthly possessions. Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt conflicted, a mix of sadness, anger and pain welled deep within her. She had more questions than answers and no one left to talk to. On one hand, she was rather hurt that everything that helped make her *her* could fit into such little space. On the other, she was sad that after today she would be alone again, thrown",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

It's my laptop, a marvel of technology, essential but often taken for granted. Resting on a wooden desk, the laptop radiates a soft, warm glow. Its silvery surface is smooth, cool to the touch, decorated only with the manufacturer's logo, a half-eaten fruit illuminated in white. 

The keyboard is a neat array of black square tiles, each inscribed with white symbols, letters, numerals - the alphabet of the digital world. There's a slight indentation on the letter 'E', where my finger has repeatedly hit while typing out stories, emails, assignments.

The screen is currently alive with colour, a vibrant digital canvas where my words appear in black against the stark white background.

"A Creation Myth / Myth in General. Example: source of night & day, how islands or mountains formed, why do shadows exist?, why pain A Creation Myth: The Origin of Shadows

In the realm of ancient fables and legends, there exists a captivating creation myth about the origin of shadows. The myth hails from the indigenous tribes of Polynesia, who believed in a primordial world devoid of light and darkness, a world only of eternal twilight. They worshipped an all-powerful deity named Kāne, the god of light, and his polar opposite brother, Kāne-Mā, the god of darkness. 

Their legend illustrates an epic battle between the two divine entities, where Kāne, in his quest to bring brightness to the world, thrust a spear of pure sunlight into the heart of his brother. As Kāne-Mā fell, he split into countless pieces, each one becoming a shadow, a dark echo of every creature and object touched by Kāne's radiant spear.

"our blind date cosplays as a spot-on Overwatch character. So good that you suspect they may actually be that character. Mike stood on the sidewalk, mouth agape as he took in the sight before him.

"In a world full of supervillains, one man has a very unique job: Finding a practical use for all those wacky doomsday devices. Brandon Mills, a former physics professor, now spends his days deciphering the complex mechanisms of doomsday machines, turning tools of destruction into forces for good. For example, a laser beam intended to split the earth in half has been repurposed to power a sustainable energy source, illuminating an entire city.

His resourcefulness turns abandoned evil lairs into scientific gold mines. An earthquake maker becomes a seismic analysis tool, a freeze ray assists in medical cryopreservation research, and an asteroid magnet aids in studying space debris.

The fight continued on the small sphere, and life came forth. The mighty epic of the Gods’ battle was played in miniature as organisms fought to claim the rock for their Gods. From this struggle","A myth about creation or myths in general, such as explaining the source of night and day, how islands or mountains formed, why shadows exist, or why pain exists. The battle raged across the darkness. Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creation’s palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star, a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life.

"Quentin Tarantino gives up violence and profanity ""Hey, Sam, glad you could make it. Did you get a chance to read the script?"" Quentin Tarantino's greeting, devoid of his characteristic expletives, caused a ripple of surprise in the room that day.

Quentin Tarantino, renowned for his graphically violent and expletive-laden movies, had taken an unexpected turn. Gone were the blood-soaked frames and stinging profanities; in their place was a script filled with profound introspection and subtle humor. The film industry was abuzz with speculation and intrigue. How could the man, who immortalized violent vengeance in ""Kill Bill"" and gave us the profanity-riddled ""Pulp Fiction"", renounce his signature style?

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" In the realm of fiction, this maxim stands as an authentic beacon of wisdom. But if we delve deeper, it uncovers a paradox. For, in fiction, the beginning is not always at the start, and the end is not always where you stop. Instead, the canvas of imagination is loomed with intricate threads of characters, plots, and settings, each starting and ending at its own accord. It is where time is manipulated, blending past, present, and future in a tapestry of tales. It is where reality is an illusion, and illusions form the reality, making boundaries blur and often disappear. Yet, despite these complexities, the essence of storytelling in fiction remains simple. As Carroll suggests, it is about beginning, continuing, and ending - a journey where the start could be the end, and the end, a new beginning. One only needs to remember to stop when they come to the end.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

Her smile, as enchanting as a new dawn, promises countless joys and solace in sorrow. Meeting her feels like finding a missing piece of your soul. The genie has granted your wish and given you a dream. However, as time passes, you realize that a dream, while enchanting, is nothing more than an illusion. The girl, as perfect as she may be, is not real. Your dream teaches a cruel lesson—that reality and dreams rarely coincide, and the quest for perfection can sometimes overshadow the beauty of reality.","A genie grants you one wish, and you ask to meet the girl of your dreams.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common, cheap, and incredible. ""No. No no no no no.

He's part of a shrinking minority who fear that humanity is losing its essence in the endless drive towards technological advancement.

For them, the idea of replacing an arm, an eye, or even a kidney with synthetic, machine components is nothing short of a nightmare. For the rest of us, the wonders of cybernetic technology are a lifeline, a chance at a normal life, even an improved life.

Imagine being free from the threat of degenerative diseases, from the specter of disability. Sadly, those like Marsh can't see past their fear of the new and unknown.

"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to have a complete understanding of the truth. You have to know what you're hiding from, what you're running from.Within every lie, there is some dark spot, some blurred edge. The truth is always there; you just have to find it. So maybe I'm lying. Or maybe I'm telling the truth, because I know you won't believe me. Maybe it's both- just enough truth to convince you, just enough lie to hide behind. I'm not asking you to believe me. After everything, I know better than to ask you to trust me. But the real question here is: why? Another characteristic of liars: we're smart. There's never just one layer, there's always an ulterior motive. The trick is to understand the players, not the game. The game is easy. The rules are simple, once you figure them out. The tricky part, the one that makes each play unique",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

This is the first time I’ve witnessed a dragon die from one of these conflicts. When I examined the body, I recognized her as a new mother. A closer look revealed large growths on her hip—cancer, explaining her death. I left her body to let nature take its course and searched for her nest. Knowing her hatchlings were too young to survive alone, I found them easily. She hadn’t moved them since I first found them, likely too weak from cancer.

Whether or not the piano was actually real was something that he could not say for certain. He could remember the melodious, soft tunes it played, resonating harmoniously with the whispering of the wind and the rustling of leaves. The piano sat there, amidst the towering trees and chirping birds, a symphony of nature and music. Its black and white keys glistening in the dappled sunlight, beckoning him to immerse in the enchanting rhythm.

James often referred to himself as the “ gentleman pickpocket ”. This is due to James'insistence that he also do something for each of his victims to make their day a bit brighter while he made their pockets lighter.

"Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals

The 3rd goal is more than just words on a page. It's about imbuing every paragraph, every sentence, every word with purpose, resonating with the reader on a level that's more than just superficial. It's about the long hours spent in solitude, punctuated by cups of coffee, and the eternally blinking cursor on a blank page. 

So, when I say my 3rd goal isn't *finished*, it's because it needs more than just a beginning, middle, and an end.

"""All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!"" ``.... through the gate!"" That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet.

"The day Death died. A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was carrying an invisible burden. Her name was Clara, and she was the one who had witnessed it all: The day Death died. 

Just hours ago, she had come across a grim, shadowy figure, collapsed in a quiet alley. It was Death, the infamous harbinger of the end, now at his own end. Clara, overcome with a strange sense of compassion, cradled his spectral head in her lap as he drew his final nonexistent breaths. With Death's demise, the world became a place of perpetual existence.

"Two people discover a fountain of youth. The problem is that upon drinking the water you turn back into an infant.

"A hidden elevator is found behind a fake wall in a basement. I bought the home in late 2020.

"There are food critics and movie critics. Then there's you: the serial killer critic. 'The hardest part, I find, is not the research or the analysis, but the detached approach one must maintain. It's a deadly profession, not in the physical sense, but in its psychological impacts.

"A world where the colonial powers were cultists of eldritch gods instead of Protestant Christians/Catholics, is a realm of captivatingly dark intrigue. Wibble, wibble, the chants would echo in the night, as the cultists offered sacrifices to their arcane deities.

In such a world, hidden spheres of influence would be more critical than economic or military might. Powerful shamans would replace priests, their eerie spells bearing the force of divine edicts. Instead of crosses, the sigils of eldritch deities would be emblazoned on flags and banners, casting long, ominous shadows over newly conquered lands. 

The indigenous people, their cultures replaced by alien rituals and rites, would be forced into an uncanny servitude - not just of body but also of soul. The horrors of colonial exploitation would assume a darker, more sinister form, as they wouldn't merely be stripped of their lands, they would lose their very identities to the eldritch gods.",ai,"A world where colonial powers serve eldritch gods rather than Protestant Christians or Catholics is filled with dark and captivating intrigue.

Life, now donned in the cloak of darkness, found himself bearing witness to the finality and sorrow that comes with death. The moment lives flicker out, the overwhelming grief, and the silence thereafter, were elements he had never seen up close. In contrast, Death, now glittering in an aura of warmth, was taken aback by the vibrancy and chaos of life. The miracle of birth, the complexity of existence, the constant growth and change - it was all too much, too fast.

"Your ascent into sanity The thrill of defeating the pure incarnation of evil vibrated through every inch of my body. This thing was finally dead after four years of constant torture. It has followed me from room to room, day after day. It followed me every time I went out, every time I ate dinner, every time I went to the bathroom. This demon that had sunk its teeth deep into my chest and sucked out my lifeforce leaving only this hollow shell of the person that was. Always there, screaming, demanding to be heard, taking away everything I had ever loved. It had driven away my husband, my reason for living. He turned and fled soon after this evil had descended on us. He was far wiser than I. I stupidly believed that evil could be fought. Its cold eyes were always on me, soulless and demonic.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they formed in an atmosphere",human,"Build a World Part I: Inception. Let's begin. Imagine a much younger universe with far more mass and less violent origins. The space between planets is filled with breathable air at a pressure that supports life. Solar heat thins this atmosphere to near-vacuum close to the sun and heats it into plasma nearby. Hot charged gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases along the plane perpendicular to these poles, creating a convection current. Due to the sun's fluctuating magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may consist of several currents simultaneously. This combined heat transfer means that although regions near the sun are extremely hot, the habitable zone is vast. Additionally, solar winds become literal winds, quite strong except far from the sun. This increased total mass results in more planets, which form within an atmosphere.","Part I: Inception of World Building. I'll start.

"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to first understand the very nature of truth. You have to learn how to weave it into your fabrications so skillfully that even the most discerning mind cannot differentiate between what is real and what is not. But here's the thing: I am not a compulsive liar. Contrarily, I pride myself on transparency and authenticity. 

As a fiction writer, I do construct elaborate tales, but always within the realms of my craft, never in my personal interactions. My profession requires me to be imaginative, to spin yarns that are beguiling and captivating. However, the line between my creativity and my honesty remains clear and unblurred. 

Still not convinced? Consider this: The best liars are those who can manipulate their audience into believing their fabrications. Yet here I am, openly admitting the possibility of me being a liar. Would a true liar ever do that? I rest my case.",ai,"You claim I am a compulsive liar; prove otherwise. To be an excellent liar, one must first grasp the essence of truth and blend it skillfully into lies so that even the sharpest observer cannot tell fact from fiction.

"Write an erotic story using the worst slang terms possible for each act/body part. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like an eternity. I sat there, staring at it for what seemed like hours, my mind a whirl of confusion and curiosity. 

In front of me lay the most perplexing piece of literature I'd ever come across. Covertly disguised as a naughty narrative, this piece was a bewildering mix of the most bizarre slang terms known to human language. It read like a field guide for misunderstood metaphors, a treasure trove of naughty nomenclature. 

Each sentence was a head-scratching enigma. The author had tossed away the conventional norms of erotic fiction and dived headfirst into the realm of the unconventional. The body parts were expressed through a smorgasbord of wildly imaginative metaphors that left you blushing, chuckling, or utterly baffled. 

There was a perverse genius to it all, the way each act was described using the most unorthodox language was oddly captivating.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry Day 3: First Entry

Today marks my first day in this vast, unending wilderness. My only companions are towering trees and distant mountains, their immense stillness echoing my isolation. Survival, once a distant concept, is now my reality. I spent the day gathering berries and hunting for edible roots. Water, thankfully, is abundant thanks to a nearby stream. The solitude is both peaceful and terrifying, a paradox of emotions I cannot fully grasp. I wonder if this newfound silence will drive me mad or if it will serve as a haven from the chaos of my previous life.

"You are functionally immortal: you can die but instantly come back to life. Over the many, many years, you've become jaded and bored, robbed of the thrills and uncertainties that make life worth living. Death, an unknown abyss for most, holds no more mysteries for you. You are trapped in a cycle of endless rebirth, each revival a monotonous repetition of the last. 

Every relationship you build is transient, ephemeral compared to your endless existence. Love, friendship, enmity - all lose their charm. Time, your one true companion, has become an adversary, a cruel joke. Cities rise and fall, civilizations evolve, the world changes, but you remain constant, untouched by the ravages of time.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 3: First entry I don't know where to begin. I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually. We were blindfolded soon after we were taken, so I don't have a clear idea of where I exactly am. All I know is that we're on our own. Thirty separated into ones. I've spent the last days building a shelter. They left me in the woods, stranded, with a small backpack barely filled with supplies. This is the last thing I've found in it, along with a dull pocket knife, a canteen water bottle, a pen and some thin string, which I've been using for snares.
