Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good.

Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done. And I've got to finish the current one which is goal for this month at the very least. We'll see which one I finish editing and decide that I'm comfortable enough with it to try to publish it first. I think maybe I should aim for Goal 2 for the rest of the year. At least a little something. There's a few stories that I'd love to pull into novelette if not novella-length stories.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 1 John Day 1: John

Today, I find myself alone in this vast wilderness, banished from the world I once knew. The weight of solitude presses heavily upon my heart, and the bitter wind whispers tales of an unforgiving fate. I sit by the crackling fire, surrounded by the haunting silence of the unknown.

My mind wanders through the memories of my past life, the warmth of family and the laughter of friends. How I long for their company now! But alas, I am here, left to confront my deepest fears and face the demons that reside within.

As I gaze at the starry night sky, a flicker of hope ignites within me. Perhaps this exile is an opportunity for redemption, for self-discovery. I vow to embrace this new reality, to find solace in the beauty of nature and to cultivate a spirit of resilience.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the rugged coastline, the sound of crashing waves filling the air. As I step out, a glimmer of glass catches my eye. Curiosity piqued, I make my way towards it, and there, nestled in the sand, lies a weathered bottle. With trembling hands, I carefully extract the mysterious letter inside.

Written on delicate parchment, the words transport me back in time. ""To the seeker of stories, this message is for you,"" it begins. My heart quickens as I realize the significance of this discovery. It's as if the universe has conspired to bring this moment to me.

The sender, a 101-year-old woman named Amelia, recounts her life's journey in vivid detail. She writes of love gained and lost, of dreams fulfilled and shattered. Her words evoke a sense of longing, of a life well-lived but with lingering regrets. Amelia's story resonates deeply within me, reminding me of the fragility and preciousness of time.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common and cheap and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" These words were echoed by Thomas Henderson, a prominent advocate for human rights, as he expressed his concern over the growing acceptance of cybernetic enhancements.

While the majority of society embraces these technological advancements, Henderson believes that the potential consequences are too great to ignore. He argues that the increasing reliance on cybernetic implants may lead to a loss of what defines us as human beings. ""We are blurring the line between man and machine, and it's a dangerous path to tread,"" he warns.

Henderson further expresses his worries about the inequality that may arise from the widespread use of cybernetic enhancements. As these implants become more accessible, those who cannot afford them may be left behind, creating a new form of social divide.

"No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for one crucial task: ensuring that the robot is constantly updated and maintained.

In this utopian vision of the future, the burden of labor is lifted off our shoulders, and our time is freed up for self-improvement, creativity, and pursuing our passions. The robot serves as our loyal and tireless surrogate, dutifully going to work and earning a living wage on our behalf.

However, the responsibility of maintaining the robot becomes paramount. Just like any other machine, it requires regular updates, repairs, and occasional replacements. As the owner, it falls upon us to ensure that the robot is functioning optimally, and that it is equipped with the latest software and technological advancements.

This responsibility presents an opportunity for personal growth and development.

This story combined political drama with epic battles, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance.","Use a Civilization 5 game (or any civ game you’ve played) as a basis to create a story. (This is not an exact Civ 5 recount but an alternate version of history.) Picture a reality where the Roman Empire never fell, instead growing strong and conquering the entire world. In this alternate timeline, I played Civ 5 as the mighty Roman Empire.

While strategizing and expanding my civilization, a story came alive in my thoughts. I imagined a young, determined senator named Marcus Aurelius rising to Emperor. With his vision for a unified world, he expanded the empire far beyond what anyone expected.

However, Marcus faced tough resistance from powerful rival civilizations. The story revolved around political intrigue, military conflicts, and alliances in this alternate history. It explored Marcus’s struggle between his ambition for unity and the moral challenges he encountered.

This narrative became a captivating blend of political drama and epic warfare, as the fate of nations hung in the balance."

"All people born have a number engraved on their skin, and for the past few centuries, the number has been gradually going down. You are number 3652, one of the last remaining individuals with a four-digit number. It is a peculiar phenomenon that has puzzled both scientists and philosophers alike.

As the number on my skin slowly decreases, I can't help but feel a sense of both wonder and trepidation. What will happen when the numbers run out? Will our identities fade away? Or will a new system emerge to define us?

Some argue that the dwindling numbers signify the diminishing importance of individuality in our society. In a world that increasingly values conformity and homogeneity, our unique numbers serve as a reminder of the diversity we once celebrated.

Others propose that the decreasing numbers are a sign of humanity's collective progress. Perhaps it symbolizes our evolution into a unified global community, where our identities are no longer defined by numerical codes but by our shared values and aspirations.

The beast began to salivate, thinking its longing was about to end. The girl got out of bed carefully and tiptoed to the closet. When close enough, the arm stretched like rubber and grabbed her.

The soft sand beneath my feet was an ideal space for my thoughts to wander. I reviewed my prompt responses, each a unique creation of my imagination. The best one, in my opinion, was the one that transported readers beyond their own world.

In that response, I narrated a story of forbidden love set in a dystopian future. The characters were intricate, emotions vivid, and the plot took unexpected twists and turns. It depicted the essence of human struggle, endurance, and the power of love.

Watching the waves dance in the sun’s light, I felt a deep appreciation for their beauty."

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze",human,"Let's begin by imagining a younger, gentler universe with significantly more mass, where the space between worlds contains breathable air at a pressure that supports life. The sun's heat causes this atmosphere to thin to near-vacuum close to its surface and transforms it into plasma nearby. Charged hot gases are pushed away along the sun's magnetic poles, which pulls cooler gases inward along a perpendicular plane, creating a convection current. Because the sun's magnetic field varies, this current is unpredictable and can consist of multiple overlapping flows. This combined convection results in a vast habitable zone despite extreme heat near the sun, making solar winds genuine winds worth noting.","Picture a much younger, less violently formed universe carrying far greater mass, with breathable air filling the voids between worlds at a pressure suitable for survival. Solar heat thins this atmosphere close to the sun into near-vacuum, turning it to plasma in adjacent areas. Hot charged gases move away along magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases perpendicular to them and creating complex convection currents. The sun's shifting magnetic forces produce unpredictable, often multiple concurrent currents. These currents efficiently transfer heat, leaving an enormous habitable zone, while solar winds become true winds.","Imagine a universe that's younger and formed more peacefully, possessing a lot more mass where the emptiness between planets is filled with breathable air at a livable pressure. The sun's warmth diminishes this air to near-vacuum near its surface and ionizes it into plasma nearby. Hot ionized gases are expelled along the sun's magnetic poles, which causes cooler gases to flow inward along a right-angled plane, establishing a convection cycle. This current varies with the sun's magnetic field changes and may have several simultaneous flows. The resulting heat transfer creates a huge habitable zone despite intense solar heat close to the star, and the solar winds are effectively real winds.","Consider a universe much younger and less violently created than ours, with substantially more mass, where breathable air fills the gaps between worlds at pressures that support life. Near the sun, solar heat thins this air to a near-vacuum state and converts it to plasma at close distances. Hot charged gases are expelled along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing in cooler gases perpendicular to that path, producing a convection current that can be variable and complex due to magnetic fluctuations. This combined heat movement results in a very large habitable zone, making solar winds literal winds.","Start with a universe younger and less violently formed, containing vastly more mass and breathable air in the spaces between planets, held at survivable pressure levels. Heat from the sun progressively thins this air into near-vacuum around its surface and further ionizes it into plasma nearby. Charged hot gases get pushed away along magnetic poles, which pulls cooler gases in perpendicular to these poles, creating varying convection currents influenced by the sun's magnetic field. These currents facilitate significant heat transfer, expanding the habitable area significantly and turning solar winds into real, tangible winds.","Imagine a younger, more gently formed universe that possesses much more mass, with breathable air at livable pressure filling the voids between worlds. The sun’s radiant heat causes this air to thin near its surface into near-vacuum and transforms it into plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases are propelled outward along the sun's magnetic poles, which in turn attracts cooler gases along a plane at ninety degrees, generating convection currents. The sun’s shifting magnetic field means these currents can be unpredictable and multiple at once. This heat movement creates a vast habitable zone and makes solar winds actual winds.","Let's envisage a universe that’s younger and less violently birthed, carrying much more mass, with breathable air filling the space between worlds at pressures conducive to life. Solar heat diminishes this atmosphere near the sun to near-vacuum, ionizing it into plasma nearby. Hot plasma gases eject along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward at right angles, creating dynamic convection currents. The fluctuating magnetic field of the sun results in unpredictable, often overlapping currents that transfer heat effectively, producing a large habitable zone and real solar winds.","Consider a nascent, less violently formed universe with considerably more mass and breathable air at conditions suitable for life filling the voids between celestial bodies. Heat from the sun thins this atmosphere near its surface to near vacuum, converting it into plasma nearby. Hot, charged gases move outwards along magnetic poles, which pulls in cooler gases across a perpendicular plane, forming varying convection currents. Because of the sun’s magnetic field variations, these currents may be complex and multiple. The heat transport creates a massive habitable region and results in literal winds from solar activity.","Imagine a universe much younger and less violent in origin, containing far greater mass and breathable air at survival-level pressure in the spaces between worlds. The sun's heat thins this air to near vacuum near its surface and ionizes it into plasma at closer ranges. Charged, hot gases escape along the sun’s magnetic poles, drawing cooler gases inward across a plane at 90 degrees, generating convection currents that vary and may be multiple due to the sun’s magnetic field changes. This heat transfer leads to a vast habitable zone and makes the solar winds actual winds.","Picture a gentle, younger universe with significantly more mass, featuring breathable air at pressures that support life in the interplanetary voids.

"Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. The torrential rain washed away any hope of finding dry shelter. The traveler's heavy cloth coat, so helpful against the bitter winter cold, was his worst enemy in this lukewarm thunderstorm.

Dear Diary,

Today marks the beginning of my exile, my banishment to the vast wilderness that stretches as far as the eye can see. As I write this entry, my heart is heavy with uncertainty and trepidation. The world I once knew is now out of reach, and I must learn to survive in this harsh and unforgiving landscape.

The air is cold, biting into my skin as I take my first steps away from civilization. The towering trees cast long shadows, and the silence is deafening. I feel the weight of solitude pressing against me, a reminder of my isolation.

I must find shelter, gather food, and adapt to this foreign environment. It is a daunting task, but I am determined to persevere. Each day will be a battle against nature, against the solitary confinement of my own thoughts.

But perhaps, in this wilderness, I will find something I have been missing for so long—a chance to start anew, to rediscover myself,",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
