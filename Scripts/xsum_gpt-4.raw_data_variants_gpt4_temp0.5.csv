"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US. Hanjin's main creditors said it would be difficult to accept a request from the court presiding over the company's receivership to give it fresh funds.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, one of the country's most active, has seen a significant upsurge in activity in recent months, raising concerns among scientists about a potential major eruption.

They warn that the current increase in activity could potentially lead to a large-scale eruption, threatening the nearby city of Kagoshima and its 600,000 inhabitants.

The researchers' concerns are built on a combination of seismic data, ground deformation and gas emission measurements. In particular, the alarming rate of ground swelling around the volcano indicates a significant increase in magma supply.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging.

"Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of a sophisticated benefit fraud scheme, resulting in the embezzlement of over £450,000 of taxpayer’s money. Investigations revealed that the group had submitted fraudulent applications for tax credits and other benefits over a span of five years.

The Stoke Crown Court heard that Akhtar was the mastermind behind the operation that involved his family members and several close friends. Forensic accountants were brought in to unravel the complex web of illegal financial activities, uncovering a calculated and wilful abuse of the system. 

The prosecution said that the money stolen funded a lifestyle far beyond their legitimate means. Despite the severity of the crime, the defendants maintained their innocence throughout the trial. The judge, in his statement, said that their actions were a ""deeply regrettable betrayal of trust"" and sentenced the group to a combined total of 20 years of imprisonment.

The march then continued to the Maalbeek metro station in central Brussels, where another 16 people were killed when a third bomber detonated his explosives during the morning rush hour.

"Hibs were hammered 10-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich, while City lost 3-1 to Eskilstuna United from Sweden, in what has proven to be a disappointing week for British football clubs in the continental leagues. The colossal defeat faced by Hibs, despite their spirited performance, illuminated the glaring gap between British clubs and their European counterparts. Bayern Munich, the German titans, demonstrated their ruthlessness and superior gameplay, leaving the Scottish team in turmoil. 

City, on the other hand, succumbed to a 3-1 defeat to Eskilstuna United. The loss was a bitter pill to swallow for City fans, as hopes were high following their robust performances in domestic leagues.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a ""disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum.""

This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities.

Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses.

The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector. Whether the change will bring the desired effect in broadening the curriculum remains to be seen.",ai,"Dr Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning minister, has chosen to eliminate an annual special premium payment of Â£1.1m previously given to Northern Ireland's universities.

"The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two significant discoveries in the area, has been given the green light to further assess the full potential of its key assets.

This follows the successful drilling of two exploration wells in Senegal, both yielding considerable amounts of hydrocarbon reserves. The study will focus on determining the commercial viability of these resources, which could potentially fortify Senegal's nascent oil industry.

The approval comes as a major boost for Cairn, reinforcing their status as a leading player in the region's burgeoning oil sector. If the evaluation confirms previous estimates, Cairn could be sitting on one of the largest oilfields in West Africa.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all.

Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care.

The survey, which involved over 1,000 participants across various job sectors, reflected a persistent stigma associated with paternity leave. Many new fathers reported feeling pressured to return to work due to concerns about job security, income stability, and perceptions of traditional gender roles.

The findings highlight a need for a paradigm shift in corporate attitudes towards paternity leave. Experts argue that encouraging fathers to take their full leave can have significant benefits, not only for the child's development and the mother's postpartum recovery but also for the overall productivity and morale of employees. It's time for businesses to reassess their policies and culture and contribute proactively to nurturing an equitable workforce.",ai,"A survey of employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has endorsed this initiative, suggesting the review will ensure a more transparent and accountable broadcasting service. 

The BBC currently operates under a Royal Charter, which is up for renewal every 10 years. This review will assess its public purposes, funding, and governance structure. Critics have raised concerns about the potential for political interference, however, Davies argued that the review will only enhance the BBC’s ability to deliver high-quality content to its viewers.

"As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in north Belfast. They must do so to the sound of a single drum beat.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off Â£49 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour.

"The child, who was under 13, needed medical treatment following the attack by Ajay Jetha last year. A probation report three months earlier had identified Jetha as a potential risk to minors but lamentably, authorities failed to act. 

The attack, which occurred in Leicester, sparked public outrage and demands for a review of the probation system. It was revealed that Jetha, a 35-year-old man with a history of violent behavior, was not properly monitored after the damning report.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future with Uber announcing its expansion into the e-bike rental industry. The ride-hailing giant has acquired Jump, a startup that provides dockless electric bikes allowing users to pick up and drop off bikes anywhere in the city. This move is a strategic pivot for Uber, a company traditionally associated with private car services, showcasing their willingness to adapt to the changing landscape of urban transportation. As we move towards a more sustainable and interconnected world, shared modes of transport, including bike sharing systems like Jump, are increasingly viewed as a viable alternative to private vehicle ownership.

"Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had ""fragile"" staffing levels and needed to ""implement more robust human resource strategies.""

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has issued a stark warning about frailty in police staffing levels, stating that the force currently operates with ""fragile"" staffing levels and needs to ""implement more robust human resource strategies."" This recent assessment has thrown light on the intensifying pressure faced by law enforcement agencies around the country, which are grappling with budget cuts and rising crime rates.

The Inspectorate called for immediate action to address the issue, suggesting that workforce planning and recruitment efforts are not keeping pace with the departure or retirement of experienced staff. HMIC emphasized that higher quality leadership and management, coupled with the implementation of a more strategic workforce plan, can help to stave off the staffing crisis.

Public safety is potentially at risk if these concerns are not addressed promptly. The HMIC's findings serve as an urgent call to action for the police forces to bolster their ranks and ensure the public's trust in their ability to maintain law and order.",ai,"Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reported that the force has ""fragile"" staffing levels and must ""implement more robust human resource strategies.""","The HMIC has warned that police staffing is ""fragile"" and requires the adoption of stronger human resource strategies.","According to HMIC, the force is operating with ""fragile"" staffing and needs to strengthen its human resource strategies.","The Inspectorate highlighted ""fragile"" staffing levels in the force and called for more robust human resource strategies.","Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary stated that staffing levels are ""fragile"" and urged the force to improve its human resource strategies.","HMIC issued a warning about ""fragile"" staffing and the need for enhanced human resource strategies.","The police force's staffing is ""fragile,"" said HMIC, which recommended more robust human resource strategies.","HMIC emphasized the force's ""fragile"" staffing and the necessity to implement stronger human resource strategies.","The Inspectorate of Constabulary noted ""fragile"" staffing levels and stressed the importance of better human resource strategies.","Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary called the staffing ""fragile"" and advocated for more effective human resource strategies."
"Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to restore and revitalize the native woodland environment. 

The initiative, supported by the Scottish Natural Heritage, aims to combat the continuous deforestation that has plagued the country and foster a more sustainable ecology. Rehabilitation of the woodland through planting acorns will bring back the natural biodiversity that once thrived in these areas.

Not only will the project aid in environmental recuperation, but it will also provide a habitat for local wildlife, particularly endangered species who rely on the forest ecosystem for survival. It is expected that the reforestation will attract a range of fauna, from birds to mammals, contributing to a more balanced ecosystem.

Furthermore, the initiative will provide an educational opportunity for the local community, allowing them to engage with nature in a meaningful and hands-on way.

"North, 24, landed on his head after a high tackle from Adam Thompstone in his side's 19-11 defeat against Leicester Tigers on Saturday. The incident sparked major concern for the player's health as North remained motionless on the pitch for several minutes before being stretchered off.

Medical staff were quick to tend to the rugby star, with early reports suggesting that he may have suffered a concussion. The incident has reignited debates about player safety in rugby, with some calling for stricter enforcement of high-tackle rules.

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 4.9%, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This static rate reflects the stability in the UK job market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. 

The numbers signify that the UK economy continues to display resilience, maintaining a relatively low level of unemployment. Economists have noted the robustness of the job market, attributing it to a combination of flexible working arrangements and sustained consumer spending.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy owners to potentially evade tax obligations. 

The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to potentially dodge tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly leading the probe, which could hold significant implications for global finance. 

Bearer bonds, which were outlawed in the US in 1982 due to their use in money laundering and tax evasion, are still legal in other countries, including Switzerland. Critics argue that these unregistered securities are a loophole in tax law that primarily benefits the ultra-wealthy. 

The investigation comes amid increased efforts by US authorities to crack down on offshore tax evasion. The Swiss bank, which has not been named, could face severe penalties if found guilty of facilitating tax evasion through the sale of bearer bonds.

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.

"England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Tom Wood. This has left coach Eddie Jones scrambling for options before their Six Nations championship clash against Scotland.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been identified in a recent research study conducted by the College of Policing. The findings suggest that officers were primarily focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other significant risk factors.

The research highlighted the need for deeper insights and broader scopes in threat assessments to ensure comprehensive law enforcement. The three unnamed police forces have reportedly taken the findings on board and are now reassessing their approaches to address this issue.

"Sterling rose 1.86% against the dollar to $1.32.40, and was 1.73% higher against the euro, marking its strongest performance in over a year. This surge has been attributed to a combination of factors, including continued post-Brexit optimism and stronger than anticipated economic data.

"The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies.

According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients.

The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS.

This dispute underscores a broader tension within the healthcare sector, as professionals and policymakers grapple with how to best manage and deliver care in an increasingly complex and challenging environment.

Government funding for the charity will be tapered down from 2015 eventually to nothing, meaning it will have more freedom than now to generate income from commercial activities and philanthropic donations. Some of the £80m awarded by the government will help to set up the charity so it will be fully operational by",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
"Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there were increasing concerns about the number of Australian teenagers being radicalized and trying to join extremist groups overseas. The 17-year-old, whose identity has been withheld due to privacy laws, was stopped under Operation Rampart, a joint initiative by the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, aimed at identifying and deterring individuals from travelling overseas to participate in hostile activities. 

Mr. Dutton warned that extremist groups were actively targeting vulnerable young Australians online, leveraging their sense of isolation or grievances to push radical ideologies. The incident underscores the ongoing threat of homegrown extremism, in a country that has largely been insulated from the global scourge of terrorism.

The Minister urged parents and guardians to keep a vigilant eye on the online activities of their children, raising awareness of the risks associated with radicalisation.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but recent developments have urged a reconsideration of the case. The Mcleod family has long suspected foul play, alleging a cover-up by the local police force.

The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) has now decided to reopen the case, following numerous appeals by the family and the emergence of new evidence. A fresh autopsy report suggests that Mcleod could have suffered internal injuries before drowning, contradicting the initial findings of accidental death by drowning.

The Mcleod family's relentless pursuit for justice and the new autopsy findings have sparked a nationwide conversation about accountability and transparency in law enforcement agencies.

The SPA has expressed its commitment to a comprehensive review of the case. They hope their efforts will provide the family with the answers they have sought for over two decades and potentially bring to light any misconduct or negligence that may have occurred.

"The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park.
