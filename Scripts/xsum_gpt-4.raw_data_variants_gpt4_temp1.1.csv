The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night voting session, further polarizing the already divided nation. 

Opponents of the initiative argue that it is a thinly veiled attempt by the government to whitewash the crimes of exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, allowing him to return without facing corruption charges.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, one of the country's most active, has seen a significant upsurge in activity in recent months, raising concerns among scientists about a potential major eruption.

They warn that the current increase in activity could potentially lead to a large-scale eruption, threatening the nearby city of Kagoshima and its 600,000 inhabitants.

The researchers' concerns are built on a combination of seismic data, ground deformation and gas emission measurements. In particular, the alarming rate of ground swelling around the volcano indicates a significant increase in magma supply.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status.

With under 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m annually, protesters argue that losing the small institution premium combined with cuts in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding will cause a 31% budget decrease. However, an extra Â£32m allocated to the DEL in this week’s overall budget helps reduce the impact. The college reports the added funds mean operating budgets shrink by 26.5%, a marginally better but still challenging forecast, according to principal Prof Peter Finn, who accuses Farry of making an opportunistic decision intended to pressure the college into endorsing one of his proposed teacher training streamlining solutions in Northern Ireland, none allowing St Mary’s to retain autonomy."

"The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition group rejects the proposal, claiming it lacks credibility and is likely to further militarize and complicate the Syrian conflict. 

The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition group, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), voiced strong reservations, stating that the agreement is more likely to freeze the conflict while allowing continued government attacks on opposition-held areas.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a ""disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum.""

This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities.

Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses.

The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector. Whether the change will bring the desired effect in broadening the curriculum remains to be seen.",ai,"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has chosen to abolish an annual special premium payment of £1.1m given to universities in Northern Ireland, which was usually allocated to STEM courses.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided.

Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care.

The survey, which involved over 1,000 participants across various job sectors, reflected a persistent stigma associated with paternity leave. Many new fathers reported feeling pressured to return to work due to concerns about job security, income stability, and perceptions of traditional gender roles.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future with Uber announcing its expansion into the e-bike rental industry. The ride-hailing giant has acquired Jump, a startup that provides dockless electric bikes allowing users to pick up and drop off bikes anywhere in the city. This move is a strategic pivot for Uber, a company traditionally associated with private car services, showcasing their willingness to adapt to the changing landscape of urban transportation.

"Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, akin to Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices using voice commands, delivering a hands-free, convenient experience. However, in a bid to make this feature more accessible, Google announced recently that it will be expanding the availability of Google Assistant to a wider range of smartphones.

This strategic move aims to compete directly with Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, offering users of other Android devices the same high-quality, intelligent voice-controlled virtual assistant. This expansion will enable more users to enjoy the benefits of Google Assistant, such as setting reminders, sending texts, or asking for directions, all by just using their voice.

"The 23-year-old Heracles forward claimed he was waiting to finalise a move to the Championship club. Slade insisted there was no hitch in the negotiations and the delay was purely down to the complicated process of international transfers. The striker, who has been in scintillating form for the Dutch side this season, has been on the radar of several clubs across Europe, but the unnamed Championship club has seemingly won the race for his signature.

Slade, the club's manager, said, ""We're looking forward to adding this talented young player to our ranks. He's shown great potential and we believe he can help us achieve our goals this season."" The exact details of the deal are yet to be disclosed, but it's believed to be a multi-year contract with a significant buy-out clause.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms.""

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%. On Thursday figures showed China's factory output contracting for the first time in six months. Economic growth slowed to a five-year low of 7.3% last quarter. Many economists had expected China to stimulate economic growth through fiscal spending rather than lowering rates. To offset the effect of lower rates on savers the bank said it would give banks the flexibility to offer higher deposit rates, up to 1.2 times the benchmark level, rather than 1.1 times. Shares in mining companies jumped by 3-4% after the cut on the hope that better growth would help sales of raw materials to China. Shares in Rio Tinto surged 3.9% percent and BHP Billiton rose 2.9%.

"England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Tom Wood. This has left coach Eddie Jones scrambling for options before their Six Nations championship clash against Scotland. 

The RFU confirmed on Monday that Haskell, Jones, Williams, and Wood have all picked up injuries during training. Haskell and Williams suffered foot injuries, Sam Jones sustained a fractured leg, while Wood is nursing a shoulder injury. 

The injury crisis is a huge blow for England, who have been enjoying a solid run in the Six Nations Championship. This comes as an unexpected disruption to their preparation, which had been focused on maintaining their unbeaten run in the championship. 

Despite the setback, Coach Eddie Jones seemed optimistic. ""We have depth in the squad, which will allow other players to step up,"" he said.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been identified in a recent research study conducted by the College of Policing. The findings suggest that officers were primarily focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other significant risk factors. This bias towards violent offences may be compromising the efficacy of policing in these areas, potentially leaving citizens vulnerable to other types of crime.

The research highlighted the need for deeper insights and broader scopes in threat assessments to ensure comprehensive law enforcement. The three unnamed police forces have reportedly taken the findings on board and are now reassessing their approaches to address this issue.

The findings also urge for improved training and resource allocation, particularly for areas of crime that may not involve violence but are equally detrimental, such as cybercrime, fraud, and drug offenses.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies.

According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients.

The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS.

The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene. An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings by establishing alternate crewing at",human,"Removing the engines, which have been inactive for two years, would reduce the number to 142 active vehicles in the capital. The savings gained from this plan would be used to increase staffing for Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has warned it would be ""dangerous and reckless"" to permanently dispose of them. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has issued three saving plans, assuring that no stations will close and no firefighters will lose their jobs. The Brigade stated that despite the 13 engines being out of service, London-wide attendance time targets have been consistently met. Reintroducing the engines would decrease the first engine’s response time by roughly four seconds. Another proposal by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore suggests reinstating the 13 engines while saving money through alternative crewing methods.","The engines, unused for two years, could be removed, resulting in 142 active fire vehicles in the capital. Money saved would be invested in increasing staff availability for Fire Rescue Units. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) cautions that permanently removing these engines would be ""dangerous and reckless."" The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has presented three different plans aimed at savings without closing any stations or forcing firefighters out of their positions. The Brigade claims that attendance time targets across London have been met even with the 13 engines inactive. Restoring the engines to service would speed up response times by about four seconds on average for the first responding unit. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has proposed a different plan to restore the 13 fire engines and cut costs by introducing alternate crewing.","The plan to remove the engines, idle for two years, would leave 142 fire vehicles operational in the capital. Savings from this move would be channeled toward adding more crew members for Fire Rescue Units. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) criticized this action as ""dangerous and reckless"" if done permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) disclosed three strategies for savings, committing to keeping all stations open and firefighters employed. Even with 13 engines out of service, the Brigade claims to have met city-wide response time standards. Reactivating these engines could reduce response times by about four seconds for the first responder. Andrew Dismore, a London Assembly Member, suggests maintaining the 13 engines but achieving savings through alternate crewing arrangements.","Removing the engines that have remained unused for two years would reduce active vehicles to 142 in the capital. The savings from this would support hiring additional staff for Fire Rescue Units. Nonetheless, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) labeled the permanent removal of these engines as ""dangerous and reckless."" The London Fire Brigade (LFB) outlined three plans to achieve savings without shutting any stations or making firefighters redundant. Despite these engines being out of service, attendance targets across London have been met according to the Brigade. Returning these engines would likely quicken the first engine’s arrival by about four seconds. An alternate savings plan proposed by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore involves reinstating the engines but adopting alternate crewing.","The proposal to remove the idle engines of the past two years would leave a fleet of 142 active fire vehicles in the capital. The funds saved would be invested in increasing Fire Rescue Units’ staffing. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) strongly opposes permanent removal, calling it ""dangerous and reckless."" The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has shared three approaches toward savings, promising no closures or layoffs. They affirm hitting attendance time goals London-wide even with the 13 engines out of use. Putting the engines back would cut down initial response times by approximately four seconds. A competing suggestion by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore advocates for putting the 13 engines back with savings realized through alternate crewing.","Taking out the fire engines, which have not been in use for two years, would result in only 142 active vehicles in London's capital. Savings from this will be applied to boost the numbers of staff operating Fire Rescue Units. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) considers permanent removal as ""dangerous and reckless."" London Fire Brigade (LFB) has published three saving strategies, ensuring stations remain open and firefighters retain their roles. The Brigade reports that London-wide attendance targets have been met despite the 13 engines being idle. Reactivating these units would decrease response times for the first engine by approximately four seconds. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has proposed a plan advocating the return of the 13 engines alongside savings from alternate crewing models.","The removal of engines unused for two years would leave 142 fire vehicles active in the capital. The savings produced by this proposal would go toward staffing Fire Rescue Units better. But according to the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), permanently eliminating them would be ""dangerous and reckless."" The London Fire Brigade (LFB) issued three proposals to make savings without closing stations or firing firefighters. They claim attendance goals have still been met while the 13 engines stayed offline. Bringing the engines back would speed up first engine response time by around four seconds. London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore has put forth a different proposal to reinstate the 13 engines with alternative crewing to save money.","Removing the fire engines which have remained idle for two years would leave the capital with 142 active vehicles. The resultant savings would be redirected to increasing staff availability for Fire Rescue Units. However, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) argues such a permanent cut would be ""dangerous and reckless."" The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has unveiled three plans to realize savings without station closures or layoffs. The Brigade continues to meet the city-wide response time targets despite the 13 engines being out of service, and notes reinstating them could improve response times by about four seconds.

"The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked from City Hospital last week, triggering a wave of outrage among their colleagues. The nurses' union argues that the two were merely defending themselves against an aggressive patient, who is known to have a history of violent behavior and mental health issues. They claim that the hospital's management has failed to provide adequate security or safeguards for its staff against such incidents. This dismissal, they contend, sets a dangerous precedent and underscores a lack of support for the staff's safety. The walkout has significantly impacted the hospital operations with many non-emergency procedures being delayed.

"The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used to transfer various interfaces onto tabletops, walls, or even your own hand. 

This groundbreaking technology is paving the way for a new era of interactivity, propelling us towards a future where physical devices may become obsolete. The practical applications are endless, from providing musicians with portable, easily customizable instruments to offering a more immersive and flexible workspace for professionals.

The laser projector works by emitting a grid of infrared beams. When the user interacts with the projected interface, the beams are interrupted, and the system can calculate the exact location of the interaction. For instance, each faux piano key or button pressed on a projected keyboard can correspond to a specific note or command.

The new regulation has caused international controversy, with human rights groups expressing concerns about potential encroachment on religious freedom.

Officials insist the ban is not aimed at suppressing Islamic faith but preventing the propagation of radical ideology. The ban includes the burqa, a full-body veil, and jilbabs, which are body-covering garments. Critics suggest the ban signifies broader religious discrimination against the Uyghur Muslim minority and caution that it may increase social alienation and unrest.","Local government in Urumqi, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region capital, backed the ban, reported by state media.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of fire"", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano. ""The 1914 eruption measured about 1.5km cubed in volume,"" said the study's lead author Dr James Hickey, who has now joined the University of Exeter's Camborne School of Mines.
