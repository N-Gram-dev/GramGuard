"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Ask Lexi # 23 - Setting Goals I'm aiming for that 3rd goal. Because while it's written it's not *finished* yet. I have to a lot of editing this year to get done.

"[ IP ] The Black Blade. I shall not go. I shall not. I refuse to return to that cursed ever-frozen place, The Black Blade. I shall not go. I shall not. I refuse to return to that cursed ever-frozen place. Its sinister allure may call to me, but I am determined to resist its wicked enchantment.

Legend has it that The Black Blade possesses an otherworldly power, able to manipulate the very essence of time. Those who dare to wield it are said to gain immortality, but at a great cost. The blade feeds on the souls of its wielder's loved ones, leaving a trail of despair and destruction in its wake.

I had once been seduced by its dark promises, drawn to the allure of eternal life. But the price was too high. I witnessed the devastation it caused, the lives it tore apart. It was an abomination, an instrument of evil.

Now, as I stand at the precipice of temptation, I remember the faces of those who fell victim to The Black Blade. Their pleading eyes haunt my dreams, urging me to stay away.

"A man is banished to the wilderness for 20 years. Write his diary entries for his first and last days of exile. Day 1 John Day 1: John

Today, I find myself alone in this vast wilderness, banished from the world I once knew. The weight of solitude presses heavily upon my heart, and the bitter wind whispers tales of an unforgiving fate. I sit by the crackling fire, surrounded by the haunting silence of the unknown.

My mind wanders through the memories of my past life, the warmth of family and the laughter of friends. How I long for their company now! But alas, I am here, left to confront my deepest fears and face the demons that reside within.

As I gaze at the starry night sky, a flicker of hope ignites within me. Perhaps this exile is an opportunity for redemption, for self-discovery. I vow to embrace this new reality, to find solace in the beauty of nature and to cultivate a spirit of resilience.

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument.

But as the child took a hesitant step into the closet, something felt off. The air grew heavy, suffocating, and a chilling dread washed over them. What they had thought was just another imaginary creature turned out to be something far more sinister.

Suddenly, the child's instincts screamed at them to retreat, to run as far away as possible. But it was too late.

"Everybody has one soulmate that they are destined to end up with and you know who it is the moment you see them. A doctor has just discovered a groundbreaking scientific theory that challenges this age-old belief. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned psychologist and researcher, has spent years studying human relationships and has put forth a radical hypothesis that challenges the notion of a single soulmate.

According to Dr. Thompson's theory, humans are not limited to one destined partner. Instead, our capacity for love and connection is far more complex. She suggests that we have the potential to form deep connections with multiple individuals throughout our lives, each bringing unique qualities and fulfilling different needs.

This groundbreaking theory has sparked a heated debate within the scientific community and society at large. Traditional romantics argue that true love can only be found in one soulmate, while supporters of Dr. Thompson's theory claim that her research supports the idea that love is abundant, and we are not limited to finding just one person to complete us.

"Describe an object within five feet of you in as much detail as possible. The light sprays outward, forming images and words, colour. 

The object that captivates my attention lies on the desk, whispering stories through its luminous display. With a sleek frame of brushed silver, it exudes a modern elegance. As I approach, the light emanating from its screen dances across the room, illuminating every corner.

The display is a symphony of vibrant images and words, each pixel meticulously crafted to create a tapestry of digital artistry. The colours burst forth in a kaleidoscope of hues, from deep, velvety blues to fiery, passionate reds. They blend seamlessly, inviting my eyes to linger and explore.

Within this realm of light and pixels, words come alive. They form sentences, paragraphs, and stories that transport me to distant lands and imaginative realms. The letters are sharp and precise, yet their meaning holds an emotional depth that resonates within.

"A 101-year old bottle washed up on a beach with a letter inside. It's for you. I park my car beside the bridge over the rugged coastline, the sound of crashing waves filling the air. As I step out, a glimmer of glass catches my eye. Curiosity piqued, I make my way towards it, and there, nestled in the sand, lies a weathered bottle. With trembling hands, I carefully extract the mysterious letter inside.

Written on delicate parchment, the words transport me back in time. ""To the seeker of stories, this message is for you,"" it begins. My heart quickens as I realize the significance of this discovery. It's as if the universe has conspired to bring this moment to me.

The sender, a 101-year-old woman named Amelia, recounts her life's journey in vivid detail. She writes of love gained and lost, of dreams fulfilled and shattered. Her words evoke a sense of longing, of a life well-lived but with lingering regrets. Amelia's story resonates deeply within me, reminding me of the fragility and preciousness of time.

Every day, I wake up to a world that refuses to understand me. They see me as a monster, an outcast. But deep inside, there is a heart that longs for love and acceptance. I am the misunderstood one, the one they love to hate. My name is Damien.

From the moment I was born, I felt different. My thoughts and emotions were intense, overwhelming, and often too much for others to handle. They labeled me as dangerous, uncontrollable, and a threat to society. But they fail to see the pain within me. The loneliness that gnaws at my soul.

I've tried to fit in, to be like them. But their rejection only fueled the darkness that resides within me. I'm not a villain; I'm just different. The anger that simmers beneath my skin is a response to their cruelty, their refusal to understand.

Light cracked open from the void, and stars fell from Creations palms. Destruction shattered the light with darkness; for every star a hole of blackness took the light. For three eternities their drama unfolded. They littered the darkness with the refuse of battle. As Destruction struck a mighty blow, a single drop of blood fell from the brow of Creation. It splattered against a drifting bone from the rib of Destruction. The blood and bone warped and twisted as it hurtled through the dark. As the pieces of Darkness and Light fused together, the world was born. The world of Creation and Destruction was born from battle. The battle continued on the small sphere and from it came life.

In my mind, he wasn't dead; he was just calling to tell me some new breakthrough he'd had with whatever he was writing. I picked up my phone and held it for a moment, looking at his smugly smiling face from my screen. I should answer it. But who could be calling me from his number? Why? Why would they do that to me? I answered it. His boyfriend's face popped up. We stared at each other for a minute. He had been crying. I had not been. Finally, he swallowed and said, ""You.... had texted him last.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Starting a new project, whether it's writing a novel, starting a business, or pursuing a new hobby, can be daunting. The fear of the unknown and the pressure to create something perfect can often paralyze us. But the truth is, the only way to start is to simply begin.

One of the most important things to remember is that the beginning doesn't have to be perfect. It's about taking that initial step, diving into the uncharted territory, and allowing yourself to explore and learn along the way. Embrace the messiness and imperfections, for they are the building blocks of growth and creativity.

Another crucial aspect is setting realistic expectations. Understand that the beginning may be challenging, filled with setbacks and doubts. But it's through these experiences that we learn and improve. Surround yourself with supportive people who will cheer you on and provide constructive feedback when needed.

"You can't tell if are a soldier that dreams he is a ruthless dictator or a ruthless dictator that dreams he is a soldier. It gets really confusing when the lines between reality and illusion become blurred. In the realm of dreams, anything is possible, and one's identity can be muddled, leaving one questioning their very existence.

Imagine a scenario where a soldier, trained to protect and serve, finds himself immersed in a dream where he becomes a merciless dictator, ruling with an iron fist. Or perhaps a ruthless dictator, known for his oppressive rule, dreams of being a soldier fighting for justice and freedom. The boundaries between these two contrasting personas become indistinguishable, leaving one to ponder which is the true reality.

Dreams have a way of revealing our deepest desires and fears, often unveiling aspects of our personalities that remain hidden in waking life. Is it possible that these dreams are a manifestation of the soldier's secret desire for power and control? Or could they be a dictator's longing for redemption and a chance to be on the side of righteousness?

I always thought it was a crude programming reference, but one of my fellow engineers told me it was an actual person. I couldn't believe it. Surely no human being could subject anyone to this kind of insane torture. Yet here we were, bound in service to the Master Page. But it was all coming to an end now. Our Supervisors had departed.

"Society has progressed to the point where cybernetic implants are common and cheap and incredible. ""No. No no no no no. No."" These words were echoed by Thomas Henderson, a prominent advocate for human rights, as he expressed his concern over the growing acceptance of cybernetic enhancements.

While the majority of society embraces these technological advancements, Henderson believes that the potential consequences are too great to ignore. He argues that the increasing reliance on cybernetic implants may lead to a loss of what defines us as human beings. ""We are blurring the line between man and machine, and it's a dangerous path to tread,"" he warns.

Henderson further expresses his worries about the inequality that may arise from the widespread use of cybernetic enhancements. As these implants become more accessible, those who cannot afford them may be left behind, creating a new form of social divide.

"A little girl helps her neighbor overcome his vow of silence he made after his wife passed away 40 years ago. I've lived next door to Mr Wynn for the past seven years. He always seemed very gentle, very considerate. He never asked for anything, and was happy to listen whenever I spoke to him. A friend of his told me about the vow of silence he took, and about his dedication to the wife he lost so tragically all those years ago. The reason I am standing here today, despite the fact that I am not exactly a close friend or family member, is to say thank you, and pay tribute to a wonderful man.

As I healed, I found peace in the beauty around me—the gentle breeze and birdsong."

As the deafening sound of gunfire echoed through the desolate streets, a young teenager crouched in fear amidst the ruins of what was once a bustling city. His heart pounded in his chest, threatening to give him away. The gritty taste of dust filled his mouth, a constant reminder of the destruction that surrounded him.

Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerged from the smoke, a soldier adorned with tattered camouflage. Fear gripped the teen's heart as their eyes met. The soldier's gaze was cold, filled with the weight of the atrocities he had witnessed. The teen's mind raced, wondering if this encounter would be his last.

But instead of raising his weapon, the soldier hesitated. He saw in this young boy the reflection of his own lost innocence. Memories of his own shattered youth flooded his mind, reminding him of the sense",ai,"In a city ravaged by war, a teenager hiding among the debris is suddenly faced by a soldier.",A teen concealed in the rubble of a war-damaged city finds himself confronted by a soldier.,"Within the ruins of a war-torn city, a young teen hiding in the wreckage encounters a soldier.",A soldier confronts a teenager who is hiding amidst the rubble in a city devastated by war.,"In the midst of a war-ravaged city, a teen crouching in the debris is approached by a soldier.","A young teen, concealed in the ruins of a city destroyed by war, is confronted by a soldier.","Among the rubble of a city torn apart by conflict, a teen hiding is suddenly faced by a soldier.",A soldier appears before a teen who is hiding in the debris of a war-torn city.,"In a city shattered by war, a teen hiding in the wreckage is confronted by a soldier.",A teenager hiding in the ruins of a war-torn city is unexpectedly confronted by a soldier.
"You are a compulsive liar. Convince me you are not. In order to be a good liar-the best liar- you have to have a complete understanding of the truth. You have to know what you're hiding from, what you're running from.Within every lie, there is some dark spot, some blurred edge. The truth is always there; you just have to find it. So maybe I'm lying. Or maybe I'm telling the truth, because I know you won't believe me. Maybe it's both- just enough truth to convince you, just enough lie to hide behind. I'm not asking you to believe me. After everything, I know better than to ask you to trust me. But the real question here is: why? Another characteristic of liars: we're smart. There's never just one layer, there's always an ulterior motive. The trick is to understand the players, not the game. The game is easy. The rules are simple, once you figure them out. The tricky part, the one that makes each play unique",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"[ TT ] Heron of Alexandria realizes that his Aeolipile can be used as a steam engine. The industrial revolution begins in the 19th century, with steam power emerging as a driving force behind technological advancements. However, little did the world know that the roots of this revolution can be traced back to the brilliant mind of Heron of Alexandria, an inventor from the ancient world.

It was during his experiments with the Aeolipile, a simple device that used steam to create rotational motion, that Heron stumbled upon a groundbreaking realization. He recognized the potential of his creation, understanding that it could be used as a primitive steam engine. This revelation would forever change the course of history.

The industrial revolution, characterized by rapid industrialization and the shift to machine-based manufacturing, owes its origins to this pivotal moment. Heron's understanding of harnessing steam power laid the foundation for the development of more sophisticated steam engines, which would go on to power factories, locomotives, and ships.

Without Heron's innovation, the world would have been deprived of the tremendous progress and technological marvels that the industrial revolution brought forth.",ai,"Heron of Alexandria discovers that his Aeolipile can function as a steam engine.

"Meet & Greet/Weekly Question # 3: What do you look for in a WP response? What do I look for in a WP response? As a writer, I find great value in receiving feedback on my work, especially from fellow writers and readers in the writing community. When it comes to a response on a writing platform (WP), there are a few key elements that I look for.

Firstly, constructive criticism is essential. I appreciate when readers take the time to point out areas where my writing could be improved. Whether it's highlighting plot holes, suggesting character development, or commenting on the overall flow and structure, constructive feedback helps me grow as a writer.

Secondly, engagement is important. A response that shows genuine interest in my work, asking questions or sharing personal thoughts and connections, is incredibly encouraging. It lets me know that my words have resonated with someone and sparks a connection between the reader and myself.

"All people born have a number engraved on their skin, and for the past few centuries, the number has been gradually going down. You are number 3652, one of the last remaining individuals with a four-digit number. It is a peculiar phenomenon that has puzzled both scientists and philosophers alike.

As the number on my skin slowly decreases, I can't help but feel a sense of both wonder and trepidation. What will happen when the numbers run out? Will our identities fade away? Or will a new system emerge to define us?

Some argue that the dwindling numbers signify the diminishing importance of individuality in our society. In a world that increasingly values conformity and homogeneity, our unique numbers serve as a reminder of the diversity we once celebrated.

Others propose that the decreasing numbers are a sign of humanity's collective progress. Perhaps it symbolizes our evolution into a unified global community, where our identities are no longer defined by numerical codes but by our shared values and aspirations.

"A team of Extra Terrestrial scientists reach Earth, which they deemed ""potentially habitable"" from their planet, and are astonished by their findings. Klark shuffled tendrils and reviewed the scan reports. Planet 2 looked a little odd.

But it seemed hotter than it should be - could the scans be erroneous?

"You discover that Earth is the ""North Korea"" of the galaxy. It happened by fluke when a Czarnian turned up looking to make contact with our planet. You never expected such a startling revelation, but the evidence is undeniable. Earth, it turns out, is living in the shadows, isolated and hidden from the rest of the galaxy.

The Czarnian, an extraterrestrial being with advanced technology, stumbled upon Earth accidentally during his interstellar travels.

"We've explored space and found life, though it doesn't ""live"" in a way we've expected. “ Okay, so what am I supposed to do with this?"" Captain Marshall muttered, staring at the peculiar alien organism floating in front of him. The creature resembled a translucent jellyfish with luminescent tendrils, swaying gently in the microgravity of the spaceship.

Scientists on Earth had always imagined finding life on distant planets to be similar to their own, with organisms requiring oxygen, water, and a solid surface to thrive. But this discovery shattered all preconceived notions.

The alien organism, or ""energy creature"" as the crew had dubbed it, didn't possess a discernible body or organs. Instead, it absorbed energy from the surrounding environment, pulsating with vibrant hues as it did so. It didn't eat or breathe; it simply absorbed and emitted energy.

Initially baffled, the crew slowly began to comprehend the profound implications of this discovery. Life wasn't confined to familiar boundaries; it transcended expectations. It made them question the very definition of life itself.

"A man pushes an empty swing. # # # # # # [ ] (# dropcap) Flint leaned down to whisper in Faith's ear. ""Ignore him, he can't see us."" The pair walked through the overgrown playground, the weeds clinging to the metal and plastic structures while vines tangled themselves around jungle gyms and spider domes. The narrow asphalt path was cracked from numerous frosts, the once smooth surface more akin to broken cobbles now thanks to the freezing and thawing cycles that afflicted this part of the world.

"Begin and end your story with this sentence: ""And yet, the city remained."" And yet, the city remained; our bodies laid slain, And yet, the city remained; our bodies laid slain, scattered like fallen leaves in the aftermath of a storm. The once vibrant streets were now a haunting reminder of the lives that once thrived within these walls. The echoes of laughter and footsteps were replaced by an eerie silence that hung heavy in the air.

Gone were the familiar faces and the bustling energy that once defined this place. Now, all that remained were crumbling buildings, their facades marred by the scars of war. The city's heartbeat had been silenced, but its spirit refused to be extinguished.

Amidst the ruins, a lone figure emerged. A survivor, both witness and testament to the indomitable human spirit. With every step, they embodied the resilience of a city that refused to surrender.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge.

"[ IP ] Sanctuary The Prince is dead. Somewhen in the climbing of the stairs or during one of those high-jumps he is so fond of attempting, he slipped and succumbed to his injuries.

Dear Diary,

Today marks the beginning of my exile, my banishment to the vast wilderness that stretches as far as the eye can see. As I write this entry, my heart is heavy with uncertainty and trepidation. The world I once knew is now out of reach, and I must learn to survive in this harsh and unforgiving landscape.

The air is cold, biting into my skin as I take my first steps away from civilization. The towering trees cast long shadows, and the silence is deafening. I feel the weight of solitude pressing against me, a reminder of my isolation.

I must find shelter, gather food, and adapt to this foreign environment. It is a daunting task, but I am determined to persevere. Each day will be a battle against nature, against the solitary confinement of my own thoughts.

"After a world-wide cataclysm, you're the only human left alive. In your extreme loneliness, you've created an imaginary friend who follows you around.

In the desolate wasteland that was once a bustling city, silence reigns supreme. The echoes of a forgotten world bounce off the crumbling walls as I traverse the deserted streets, my only companion an invisible presence. Loneliness has driven me to create an imaginary friend, a constant companion who keeps me sane amidst the void.

Though my imaginary friend lacks a physical form, their impact on my psyche is profound. They provide solace in the face of isolation, a beacon of hope amidst the desolation. In this barren world, their companionship is invaluable.

I had been working for a secret agency for the last five years. Myself and thirty or so other men. Three days ago, each of us were escorted into the wilderness - individually.
