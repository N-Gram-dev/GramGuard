"Mr Joshua told his congregation on Sunday that he ""saw"" a woman winning. After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the preacher's website were met with a curious update.  Instead of admitting a mistaken prophecy, Mr. Joshua's team claimed the ""woman"" was actually the American people, and that Trump's victory marked a new chapter for the nation.

The incident has raised questions about the legitimacy of prophetic claims and the expectations placed upon self-proclaimed seers.

"##  Diamonds Stolen in Daring Airport Heist

Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the gems. The daring heist, which took place at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport, saw thieves make off with a large quantity of diamonds worth an estimated $20 million.

"## Flower Denies Housing Links Influenced 2013 Debate

Spencer Flower claimed his involvement with a social housing company was not relevant to a debate in 2013 over the future of housing in east Dorset. The former councilor, now running for re-election, faced questions about his connection to ""Homes for All,"" a non-profit organization he served on the board of directors for. Critics have argued that his position could have influenced his stance on the 2013 debate, which saw a heated discussion over the allocation of public housing funds. 

Flower maintains that his work with ""Homes for All"" was separate from his political activities and that his position was based solely on the needs of the community. ""I believe in affordable housing for everyone,"" Flower said, ""and my commitment to that principle is unwavering."" However, opponents remain unconvinced, pointing to potential conflicts of interest and questioning the transparency of Flower's actions. The debate is expected to be a key issue in the upcoming election.

"## Police Forces Under Scrutiny for Neglecting Non-Violent Crimes

Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are now being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for potential failings in their handling of non-violent crime, particularly cases related to domestic abuse. 

The IOPC investigation was triggered by a report from the College of Policing, which highlighted concerns about the prioritization of violent crime over other serious offenses. The report suggested that some police forces were neglecting non-violent crimes, potentially leading to a rise in repeat offenses and victims feeling unheard. The investigation aims to determine whether the identified police forces have adequately addressed these concerns and implemented appropriate measures to ensure effective crime prevention and victim support.

"## London's Red Buses Get a Makeover: Engine Removal Proposed for 142 Idle Vehicles

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal, which will be discussed at the next council meeting, could reach £1 million annually.

The decision will likely be a hotly contested one, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.

"## TfL Proposes New Driver Tests: Language, Navigation, and Landline Required

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a fixed landline telephone for all new driving licence applications. The proposed changes, aimed at enhancing road safety and driver competence, have sparked debate. 

The English language test would assess comprehension of road signs and traffic regulations, while the map-reading assessment aims to combat reliance on GPS navigation. The requirement for a fixed landline phone is intended to improve communication in emergencies, particularly in areas with limited mobile reception. 

The consultation period, open until [date], invites public feedback on the proposed changes and their potential impact on accessibility and affordability.

"The last print edition will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines.

"Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him ""significant discomfort"" for months. Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as ""unbelievable"". ""It's very unfortunate,"" said the Frenchman. ""It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again."" Debuchy has played just 14 times since signing from Newcastle in July in a deal worth a reported £12m. With Kieran Gibbs recovering from an inflamed heel, 19-year-old Hector Bellerin or Calum Chambers may deputise against Manchester City on Sunday.

"## Thai Parliament Approves Controversial Amnesty Bill

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sparking protests and raising concerns about the potential for impunity. 

The bill, which aims to reconcile the country after years of political instability, covers a wide range of offences, including those related to the 2010 Red Shirt protests and the 2014 military coup. Critics argue that it would allow for the return of exiled politicians, including Mr Thaksin, and could shield those responsible for human rights abuses. 

Supporters, however, maintain that the amnesty is necessary to move the country forward and bring about national unity. The bill now faces a vote in the Senate, with its fate uncertain.

"## Sunak Accuses Doctors' Union of Spreading ""Misinformation"" 

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced criticism this morning for his handling of the ongoing dispute with the British Medical Association (BMA).  In a heated interview, Sunak accused the BMA of ""playing politics"" and refusing to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" about addressing the current NHS crisis.  He reiterated his offer of a 7% pay increase over the next two years, emphasizing it was the ""fairest and most sustainable"" solution.  However, the BMA insists that this offer falls short of the necessary 30% pay rise to address the years of real-terms pay cuts and the current staffing shortages plaguing the NHS.  The ongoing deadlock threatens further disruption to patient care, with the BMA planning further strikes in the coming months.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection.

Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

"The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the Welsh Government would be consulted on the matter, but there was no requirement for a referendum.  

The party has been accused of breaking its manifesto promise, with opposition parties calling for an immediate referendum. The party has defended its decision, saying that it is in the best interests of the Welsh people.

The funding floor is a controversial policy, with some arguing that it will help to protect public services in Wales. Others have argued that it will lead to a reduction in funding for vital services. 

The debate is likely to continue, with both sides of the argument making their case in the coming months.

"The firm is accused of giving large donations to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a close confidante of Ms Park. The donations were allegedly given in exchange for political support of a controversial merger. Ms Choi has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Choi Gee-sung, a Samsung vice chairman, and Chang Choong-ki, a president at the group, were being interviewed on Monday by special prosecutors about the corruption allegations.

"## New Dads Still Missing Out on Paternity Leave, Survey Finds

A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than the minimum legally mandated time off. The findings highlight a continued reluctance amongst new dads to prioritize their own wellbeing and the bonding period with their newborns.  

Experts cite a range of factors contributing to this trend, including societal expectations around masculinity, concerns about job security, and inadequate workplace policies. They emphasize the importance of encouraging men to take advantage of paternity leave, arguing that it benefits not only the father, but the entire family and workplace. The survey calls for increased awareness and support for new fathers, urging employers to foster a culture that normalizes and encourages paternity leave.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another example of that in the capital when oBike launched. It is a company backed by considerable venture capital and it's putting hundreds of hire bikes on London's streets. The company aims to have thousands in the capital by the end of the summer, after already operating huge schemes in South East Asia. The big difference compared to the existing cycle hire scheme is the bikes have no docking stations. A locking rear brake means they can be left anywhere. Users access them via an app and you can find them as they have a GPS locator. There is a one-off Â£49 refundable deposit to be paid and then 50p per half-hour. More companies are set to follow. oBike says it is aiming to work in conjunction with the existing scheme and it has a social agenda to help clean up London's air and reduce emissions. It also wants to work with Transport for London (TfL) and local councils but unfortunately that hasn't happened.

The game was so poorly received that Atari is said to have buried millions of unsold copies in a landfill in New Mexico. 

The landfill was recently excavated, and the game cartridges were discovered.

Some people hope that the cartridges can be sold for a profit, while others hope that they will be donated to museums.

"## Nurses Walk Out in Protest Over Sackings Following Patient Struggle 

The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite colleagues claiming they acted in self-defense. The incident occurred at St. Mary's Hospital on Tuesday, where a patient reportedly became aggressive and violent.  Witnesses say Gregson and Hilton were injured during the struggle, but were later dismissed for allegedly using excessive force. 

The nurses' union, the Royal College of Nursing, has condemned the dismissals, calling them ""unjustified"" and ""unfair."" The union is now calling for an independent investigation into the incident and the subsequent sackings. The walkout, which began at 8am this morning, has caused significant disruption to services at St. Mary's. Patients are being redirected to other hospitals, and elective surgeries have been postponed. It is unclear how long the walkout will continue.

"## Injury Crisis Hits England Back Row Ahead of Crucial Test

England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Ito. The injuries come at a crucial time for the team, who are preparing for their upcoming Test matches. 

Haskell, a veteran of 77 caps, suffered a knee injury during training, while Jones and Williams are recovering from respective hamstring and ankle injuries. Ito, who can play in both the second and back rows, is sidelined with a concussion.

The injuries leave head coach Eddie Jones with a depleted back row, forcing him to look at alternative options for the upcoming fixtures. This setback adds further pressure to an already challenging period for England, who are aiming for a strong performance in the upcoming Test series.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe.

"## Japan Approves Historic Legislation Allowing Troops to Fight Abroad

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the upper house, represents a significant shift in Japan's post-war security policy. It would allow the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they could fight alongside allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked.

The legislation has sparked controversy, with some arguing it will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts. Others, however, see it as a necessary step to bolster Japan's security in a rapidly changing regional landscape. The move comes amid growing tensions in the East China Sea, where Japan and China have overlapping territorial claims.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and is expected to be endorsed by the upper chamber. Under its constitution, Japan is barred from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. But a reinterpretation of the law will now allow ""collective self-defence"" - using force to defend allies under attack. Police are lining the streets and telling protesters to move along in an attempt to minimise disruption in the capital's centre. Despite the wet weather conditions, tens of thousands of protesters poured out onto the streets demanding that their pacifist constitution be protected and calling for the prime minister to step down. The streets were lined with police vans but given how unprecedented it is for the Japanese to be so vocal, there was never any fear that things would get out of hand.

Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their device using voice commands, making tasks like setting alarms, sending messages, and controlling smart home devices effortless. But in a significant move, Google has announced the expansion of Assistant's reach, making it available on Samsung Galaxy devices starting today. 

This move marks a major shift in the voice assistant landscape, opening up a whole new market for Google Assistant. With Samsung's strong foothold in the Android market, the partnership promises to make Assistant accessible to a wider range of users.

"##  Protests Turn Violent in Baghdad as Security Forces Clash with Demonstrators

Tear gas and live bullets were fired to drive back the mainly Shia Muslim crowds, as they protested against corruption and security failures. Officials imposed a curfew in Baghdad's Sadr City district following hours of unrest.  The protests, which began peacefully, escalated after a senior Iraqi cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, called for the government's resignation.

"Mrs Foster said on Wednesday that she wanted to better understand those who love the language. She said she wanted to ""listen to and engage with those from the Gaelic Irish background, those without the party political background"". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped the meeting would happen soon. ""It's a positive move,"" he said. ""Anything that encourages dialogue, that encourages conversations, that encourages increased understanding has to be positive."" Stormont's parties have ""paused"" talks to strike a deal to form an executive until after Easter. The parties have yet to find a deal almost six weeks after the assembly election.

"##  Rwenzururu King's Medical Privileges Sparks Controversy 

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But the decision to grant him access to a private hospital for treatment has sparked controversy. Critics argue that Mumbere, who is facing charges of treason and murder, should be treated in a public hospital like any other prisoner. 

The government has defended its decision, stating that Mumbere's health condition requires specialized care available only at the designated facility. However, the move has fueled concerns about unequal access to healthcare and potential preferential treatment for high-profile individuals. The debate is expected to intensify as Mumbere's trial continues.

"The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students. Dominic Scott, head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs, said it would be ""a retrograde step"" and could ""damage the UK's reputation as a welcoming destination for international students."" 

The proposed changes are part of a wider package of measures aimed at tightening immigration controls. The government argues that the stricter requirements are necessary to ensure that only those with a genuine intention to study in the UK are granted visas. However, critics argue that the changes could deter talented students from applying to UK universities.

The impact of these changes on international student numbers remains to be seen. Some experts believe that the stricter requirements could lead to a decline in applications, while others argue that the UK's universities will remain attractive to students from around the world.

"She was speaking at an event on Thursday to remember four men who were shot dead by the SAS in her home village of Clonoe in 1972.  The event was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the shootings, which remain a source of controversy and pain for the community.  The four men, who were all unarmed, were shot dead by soldiers who claimed they were carrying weapons.  However, no weapons were ever found at the scene.  The victims were identified as John McKerr, Brian Friel, Charles McElvogue and Eugene Kelly.  Their families have been campaigning for justice for decades, and the event on Thursday was a chance for them to remember their loved ones and to call for a full and independent inquiry into the shootings.

The families of the men were joined by local politicians and community leaders at the event.  They heard speeches from speakers who called for an end to the cycle of violence and for a more peaceful future.  The event was also a reminder of the ongoing pain and suffering caused by the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

"## PC Tilley Admits ""Destroying Her Career"" After Fare Evasion 

PC Frances Tilley admitted she had ""destroyed her career"" after evading payment for a journey between Bristol Temple Meads station and Castle Cary in Somerset. The officer, who has since resigned from Avon and Somerset Police, was caught on CCTV avoiding paying the £15.10 fare.  

Appearing at Taunton Magistrates' Court, Tilley pleaded guilty to a charge of fare evasion. The court heard that she had been travelling home from work and, due to a ""moment of madness"", decided to avoid paying. 

""I understand the seriousness of my actions and I am deeply sorry for the shame I have brought upon myself and the police service,"" Tilley stated. 

The incident, which has garnered significant media attention, has raised questions about the conduct of police officers and the importance of accountability.

"## S4C's Future Uncertain as BBC Review Looms

S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies told BBC Wales that the review was ""long overdue"" and that it was ""time to look at the future of the BBC in the 21st century"".

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday.

"## Newsweek Goes Digital: Print Edition to End After 85 Years

The last print edition of Newsweek will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with The Daily Beast in 2010, and the combined entity will continue to publish online and in mobile formats.

“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, which owns The Daily Beast. “The print advertising market is simply not sustainable for a weekly news magazine.” 

The move marks the end of an era for the iconic magazine, which was founded in 1933 and has won numerous awards for its journalism. However, Newsweek's online presence has grown significantly in recent years, with a strong following on social media. The company hopes to reach a wider audience by focusing on digital platforms.

"## Historic Lyndhurst Park Hotel Facing Demolition for Luxury Flats

The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling and visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson, is facing demolition. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a luxury retirement village, sparking outrage from heritage campaigners. 

The hotel, built in the 18th century, sits in a picturesque location near Lymington, Hampshire. It has been a popular destination for centuries, attracting notable figures such as Stevenson, who stayed there in the 1880s. However, the building has fallen into disrepair and has been empty for several years.

PegasusLife argues that the development will ""provide much-needed housing for the elderly"" and create jobs. However, heritage groups have condemned the plans, calling the hotel ""a vital part of local history"" and urging for its preservation. A public consultation is underway, and the fate of the Lyndhurst Park Hotel remains uncertain.
