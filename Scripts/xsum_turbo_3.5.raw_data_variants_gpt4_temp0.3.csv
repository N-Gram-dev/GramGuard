"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in a late-night session, sparking outrage among opposition parties and the public alike. The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup.

Critics argue that this bill is a brazen attempt by the ruling party to protect its own interests and maintain its hold on power. It is seen as a way to whitewash the crimes committed by politicians and their supporters during this tumultuous period.

The opposition argues that this amnesty undermines justice and accountability, sending the wrong message to the public that those in power are above the law. They believe that it is crucial for those responsible for any wrongdoing to be held accountable, regardless of their political affiliation.

Proponents of the bill, however, argue that it is necessary to heal the deep divisions within society and move forward. They claim that the amnesty will help foster reconciliation and unity among the Thai people, allowing the nation to focus on the future rather than being shackled by the past.

Regardless of the political arguments,",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT
"Helen Bailey, 51, was found dead in a cesspit at her house in Royston, Hertfordshire, in July 2016. The shocking discovery shook the community and left many questioning the circumstances surrounding her death. However, the truth behind this tragic incident has now been revealed.

"The charity wants 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by civil war to be resettled by the end of the year. Ahead of the upcoming winter season, a charity organization is urging for the resettlement of 10% of the 4.8 million Syrians displaced by the ongoing civil war.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe. Samsung Electronics has said it has goods worth about $38m on Hanjin ships in international waters. It is now considering chartering 16 freighter planes to take goods to customers - mostly in the US.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The Sakurajima Volcano on Japan's Kyushu Island Poses a ""Growing Threat"", Researchers Say

The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.

According to the researchers, who have been monitoring the volcano's activity, seismic activity has been intensifying beneath Sakurajima, suggesting that magma is rising to the surface. This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.

Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people. If a major eruption were to occur, it could have devastating consequences for the local population and infrastructure. The researchers have advised authorities to closely monitor the volcano and be prepared for a",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%.

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the think tank today and highlights a significant educational divide between different regions in the UK.

According to the study, children from disadvantaged backgrounds in London achieved better academic results compared to their peers in the north of England. The research indicates that London's success in narrowing the attainment gap is due to a combination of various factors, including effective policies and investment in education.

The aim of these de-escalation zones is to reduce violence and create a safe environment for civilians in Syria. However, opposition groups fear that this deal could further divide the country and consolidate the power of President Bashar al-Assad.

While these areas have been heavily targeted by government forces, the opposition argues that the deal fails to address the root causes of the conflict.

The FCA inquiry analyzed five years of data from 34 million cardholders and interviewed 40,000 people about their credit card use. Interim findings showed strong competition for some customers and products, but others were not targeted. Providers were quick to intervene when payments were missed, as those customers were ""extremely unprofitable,"" but not for those just managing payments. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said: ""The FCA is right to be concerned about the 1.6 million people surviving by making minimum payments on multiple credit cards. ""The report highlights that credit card companies usually intervene effectively to help customers who begin to miss payments, and many work closely with debt."""

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of £1.1m which it was awarding to a specific group of workers. The premium payment, known as the Additional Duties Allowance (ADA), was being given to support staff in the education sector, including caretakers, classroom assistants, and administrative staff.

The decision to remove the ADA has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that the funds can be better utilized elsewhere, such as improving educational resources or investing in teacher training. They believe that the ADA was an unnecessary expense that did not directly contribute to the quality of education.

However, critics argue that the removal of the premium payment will adversely affect the livelihoods of already underpaid and undervalued support staff.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace.

The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues.

Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society.

The survey findings have sparked calls for employers to reassess their policies and offer more extensive and flexible paternity leave options. It is crucial for companies to recognize the importance of supporting new fathers, fostering a",ai,"A survey of employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave.

"Mr Joshua told his congregation on Sunday that he ""saw"" a woman winning. After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the preacher's Facebook page noticed the prophecy had been removed. The wealthy pastor is known as ""the prophet"" to his many followers. He is one of Nigeria's best-known and influential evangelists - and is popular across Africa, with many top politicians among his flock. The US election prediction was broadcast on Mr Joshua's TV channel Emmanuel TV, which an individual uploaded to YouTube. A section of that ""prophecy"" was posted on the preacher's Facebook page but is no longer available. ""Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,"" it said. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa as people shared memes poking fun at his prediction. People have also taken to a Facebook entry he posted on Wednesday to complain. Clive Mashiri from South Africa asked: ""Why was the prophecy deleted?

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model.

S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain.

Davies believes that S4C should explore alternative funding models, such as partnerships with other broadcasters or introducing advertising, to ensure its long-term sustainability. He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms.

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around. This week we got another glimpse into this potential future as a major car rental company announced its plans to expand its electric vehicle fleet. 

Enterprise, the largest car rental company in the United States, revealed that it will be adding 350 electric vehicles to its offering in select cities. This move comes as part of the company's commitment to sustainability and reducing its carbon footprint. 

The expansion of the electric vehicle fleet will provide customers with a greener alternative for their transportation needs. By opting for electric vehicles, individuals can contribute to a cleaner environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. 

Enterprise's decision also aligns with the global push towards sustainable transportation solutions.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that this initiative will alleviate the strain on primary care services and reduce the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.

The opening performance, Oceanallover, coincides with the Summer solstice and was specially developed by artistic director Alex Rigg.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, marking a significant shift in the country's defense policy. The move comes as Japan seeks to redefine its role on the global stage amidst growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.

Under the new legislation, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces will be able to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they can come to the aid of allies under attack. This marks a departure from Japan's long-standing pacifist stance, which restricted its military to defend its own territory only.

The passage of the legislation has been met with mixed reactions both domestically and internationally. Supporters argue that it is necessary for Japan to play a more active role in global security, given the changing regional dynamics and the rise of new threats. Critics, however, express concerns about potential constitutional implications and the possibility of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts.

"The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also strong, reflecting a positive trend in Scotland's job market. According to the report, this surge in placements was driven by increased business confidence and a gradual reopening of the economy.

The data revealed that permanent job placements in Scotland rose at the fastest rate since October 2018. This can be attributed to several factors, including the easing of pandemic restrictions and an upturn in hiring across various sectors. The report also highlighted that the demand for temporary staff saw a robust increase, indicating a growing need for flexibility in the workforce.

Furthermore, the report underlined a rise in starting salaries for both permanent and temporary positions. This suggests that employers are competing for top talent as the job market gains momentum. With the reopening of businesses and the vaccination rollout continuing to progress, Scotland's employment landscape appears to be on a positive trajectory.

"An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation, which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012, has not paid its rent for the past two years. The shocking revelation came to light during a recent meeting of the Welsh Assembly's Economy, Infrastructure, and Skills Committee.

Cardiff Aviation, once hailed as a beacon of hope for the local economy, has been struggling financially for several years. The company, founded by aviation entrepreneur Bruce Dickinson, leased the hangar at St Athan to carry out aircraft maintenance and training. However, it seems their financial woes have caught up with them.

The committee was informed by an official that Cardiff Aviation had failed to make rent payments for the past two years. This news raises serious concerns about the company's viability and its ability to continue operating at the site. The hangar, which was previously used by the Ministry of Defence, was leased to Cardiff Aviation by the Welsh government in an effort to revive the local economy and create job opportunities.

"Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their devices through voice commands. However, Google has now announced that it is expanding the availability of Google Assistant to Android smartphones running on Marshmallow and Nougat operating systems.

This move by Google comes as a response to the growing demand for voice-activated virtual assistants. With Google Assistant now available on a wider range of devices, users will have greater flexibility and convenience in accessing the service. They can now ask questions, set reminders, send messages, and perform other tasks using just their voice.

The expansion of Google Assistant also opens up opportunities for third-party app developers to integrate their services with the virtual assistant. This means users will have access to a wider range of functionalities and capabilities, further enhancing their smartphone experience.

"Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub. Dr Tim Green wrote Mr Butler found it ""difficult to control his emotions and impulses."" Ben Butler, now infamous for the murder of his six-year-old daughter Elsa, had a history of violent outbursts that were consistently overlooked by the authorities.

"Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley.

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands.

Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease.

By planting acorns, Forest Enterprise Scotland hopes to create a sustainable ecosystem that will foster the growth of oak trees and encourage the return of diverse wildlife. This initiative aligns with the Scottish government's commitment to increase woodland coverage and combat biodiversity loss.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to take a leading role in providing long-term financing for green projects in emerging markets. Mr Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of sustainable investments for the stability of the global financial system.

During his speech in Berlin, Mr Carney highlighted that emerging markets often face challenges in accessing funding for their green initiatives. He stressed the need for developed nations, like Germany, to step up and support these projects, as they not only contribute to environmental sustainability but also promote financial stability.

"He threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid failed, and the Football Association turned it down in April. However, it seems that the controversial move may still be on the cards.

"Mark Footitt took 3-52 as the visitors lost five wickets before lunch while Sam Curran dismissed England opener Haseeb Hameed for a second-ball duck. But Clark's 108 not out from 133 balls and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's steady 85 not out rebuilt the visitor's innings. Clark reached his century with a huge pulled six shortly before the close. Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren. The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress.

"The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be vigilant and proactive in managing their credit cards to avoid falling into financial distress.

The regulatory body's recent report highlighted that a significant number of credit card users were carrying high balances for extended periods, resulting in substantial interest charges. These customers were often stuck in a cycle of minimum repayments, which barely covered the interest, let alone made a dent in the principal amount.

The FCA emphasized the need for cardholders to regularly review their payments and consider alternative repayment strategies, such as paying more than the minimum amount due or consolidating balances onto lower-interest cards.

In addition, the authority called for greater transparency from credit card providers regarding the long-term costs of carrying high balances. It urged firms to provide clearer information on interest rates and repayment options to help customers make informed decisions.

"Borrowing the names of organisations like Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency they are directly attacking the president. Mr Trump has called climate change a ""hoax"" and has repeatedly rolled back environmental regulations during his tenure. However, a group of activists have found a unique way to challenge his stance by borrowing the names of prominent organizations like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

By adopting these names, they aim to draw attention to the urgent need for action on environmental issues and highlight the stark contrast between scientific consensus and the president's dismissive rhetoric.

"Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits to administering a harmful substance with intent to endanger life. The trial began yesterday at the Oxford Crown Court, where shocking details of the case were revealed.

Julia Knight, a 56-year-old nurse, stood accused of attempting to murder Irene Robson, an 81-year-old patient, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. In a surprising twist, Knight admitted to administering a harmful substance but firmly denied any intention to murder Robson.

The prosecution alleged that Knight had deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, leading to her deteriorating health and subsequent near-death experience. They argued that Knight had harbored a grudge against Robson, although the details surrounding this alleged motive remain unclear.

During the trial's opening statements, the defense acknowledged Knight's administration of the substance but emphasized that there was no intent to kill Robson. Instead, they claimed that Knight had made an error in judgment, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms."" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would ""slip through the net"". In response, the College of Policing is setting up a pilot scheme to help officers identify possible patterns of abusive behaviour.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy.

The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change.

The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality.

If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure indicates that the UK's job market has remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit.

The ONS also revealed that the number of people in employment rose by 99,000 during the same period, reaching a record high of 32.7 million. This suggests that businesses are still hiring and expanding despite concerns about the country's future relationship with the European Union.

However, wage growth remains sluggish, with average weekly earnings increasing by only 3.2% excluding bonuses. This is below the rate of inflation, indicating that workers are not seeing much improvement in their purchasing power.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave. The research by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) blamed ""ingrained"" attitudes among employers, and concerns among new fathers that they could not afford to take leave.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to maintain anonymity in their financial transactions. The investigation comes as US authorities crack down on money laundering and illicit financial activities.

Bearer bonds are financial instruments that grant ownership rights to whoever physically holds the bond. Because ownership is not registered, they have long been associated with illicit activities, such as tax evasion and money laundering. These bonds offer an attractive option for individuals seeking to move large sums of money discreetly across borders.

The Swiss bank, which has not been named, is being scrutinized for its potential involvement in the sale and handling of these bonds. US regulators are closely examining whether the bank facilitated the transfer of bearer bonds for clients, potentially aiding in illegal financial activities.

This investigation is part of a broader effort by US authorities to increase transparency in financial transactions and clamp down on unlawful practices.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub.

This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory.

Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats.

Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries.

"The country's Chamber of Deputies had already approved the legislation. The vote in the Senate, which backed the bill by just six votes, came as a relief to proponents of the new legislation. The bill aims to address a pressing issue that has been troubling the nation for years.

The legislation focuses on implementing stricter regulations on the manufacturing and distribution of harmful substances. It seeks to crack down on the illegal drug trade and combat the growing problem of substance abuse in the country.

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of ""all information known"" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment ""turned up nothing new"" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing. The study highlighted concerns over the narrow focus of police officers, potentially leaving other vulnerable individuals at risk.

The research, which remains unpublished, analyzed the practices of three unidentified police forces in England and Wales. It found that officers were dedicating a significant amount of time and resources to cases involving violence, while other risk factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, and domestic disputes were receiving less attention.

Dr. Sarah Cooper, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of a more holistic approach in policing. She argued that by solely focusing on violent cases, officers may be missing opportunities to intervene and prevent harm in other areas of vulnerability.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea.

The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options.

The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods.

The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support.

The fallout from Hanjin's receivership serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability",ai,"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after efforts to rescue the indebted company failed.

"The company behind the abattoir in Haverfordwest, Emcol 2008 Ltd, collapsed in January 2016 with debts of £660,000. The closure of the facility came as a shock to the local community, which relied heavily on the abattoir for employment and the sourcing of locally produced meat.

Emcol 2008 Ltd had been struggling financially for some time, facing fierce competition from larger meat processing companies and an increasing demand for cheaper imported meat. Despite efforts to streamline operations and cut costs, the company was unable to recover from its mounting debt.

The closure of the abattoir not only resulted in the loss of around 50 jobs, but it also had a significant impact on local farmers who relied on the facility to process their livestock.

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal troubles. The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates in the upcoming elections, as the party prepares to defend its position in Parliament.

However, much attention is focused on the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thompson, two former MPs who have faced legal challenges. McGarry was found guilty of embezzling funds from a pro-independence campaign group, while Thompson faced charges of assault and domestic abuse.

The party will have to decide whether to allow these individuals to run as candidates, despite their legal issues. While some argue for forgiveness and second chances, others believe that allowing them to stand as representatives undermines the party's credibility and integrity.

"Matthew Eteson is on trial at Preston Crown Court for the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster, 36, and Lauren Thornton. The pair died after being overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning on a boat trip in the Lake District in 2013.

"Spencer Flower claimed his involvement with a social housing company was not relevant to a debate in 2013 over the future of housing in east London. However, newly surfaced documents suggest otherwise. Flower, a prominent figure in the property development industry, vehemently denied any connection to the social housing sector during the heated discussion six years ago.

But recently obtained records reveal that Flower was, in fact, closely associated with a social housing company at the time. These documents shed light on his undisclosed role as a consultant for the company, raising questions about his credibility and transparency.

The debate in question centered around the rising need for affordable housing in the eastern part of the capital. Flower's attempt to distance himself from the social housing sector casts doubt on his motives and raises concerns about his integrity.

Critics argue that Flower's attempt to downplay his involvement with the social housing company undermines his credibility as a proponent for affordable housing solutions.

The report analyzed the net worth of the world's wealthiest individuals and found that the top 1% now control an astounding $6 trillion, equivalent to the GDP of several major economies. This concentration of wealth raises concerns about income inequality and its implications for social and economic stability.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a driving skills evaluation, and a customer service training course for all private hire drivers in the city. The move comes as part of TfL's efforts to ensure a high standard of service and safety for passengers.

The proposed new requirements aim to address concerns over communication barriers and navigational difficulties faced by some private hire drivers. The English language test would ensure that drivers have a sufficient level of proficiency to effectively communicate with passengers, while the map-reading assessment would test their ability to navigate the city's complex road network.

Additionally, the driving skills evaluation would focus on assessing drivers' awareness of traffic rules and regulations, as well as their ability to handle various driving scenarios. The customer service training course would aim to improve the overall passenger experience by providing drivers with essential skills in dealing with customers professionally and courteously.

As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street in Belfast.

"Meanwhile, Burundian police said they had arrested two foreign journalists who were reporting on armed groups. Violence in the country began last April when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his controversial bid for a third term, leading to widespread protests and subsequent crackdowns.
