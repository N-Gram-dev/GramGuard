"Question: Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? Answer: The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.",human,"Could the scope of lymphadenectomy be altered by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The occurrence and location of lymph node metastases remain unchanged by NACT, with clinical non-responders exhibiting more affected lymph nodes. Therefore, a comprehensive systemic lymphadenectomy is advised for patients undergoing NACT followed by surgery, irrespective of their response to NACT.","Is it possible to change the extent of lymphadenectomy through neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The frequency and distribution of lymph node metastases are not affected by NACT; patients who do not respond clinically have more involved lymph nodes. Hence, patients receiving NACT and surgery should undergo extensive systemic lymphadenectomy regardless of NACT response.","Can neoadjuvant chemotherapy influence the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer? NACT does not alter the frequency or anatomical distribution of lymph node metastasis, and those with no clinical response have greater lymph node involvement. Thus, comprehensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in all patients treated with both NACT and surgery, regardless of their response to chemotherapy.","Does neoadjuvant chemotherapy modify lymphadenectomy extent in cervical cancer? The pattern and frequency of lymph node metastasis remain unchanged after NACT, with clinical non-responders showing increased lymph node involvement. Consequently, patients treated with NACT plus surgery should always have a wide and systemic lymphadenectomy regardless of how they respond to NACT.","Is the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer patients affected by neoadjuvant chemotherapy? The rate and topographic spread of lymph node metastases are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders have more affected nodes. Therefore, a systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy is recommended for all patients who undergo NACT followed by surgery, irrespective of their response status.","Can the lymphadenectomy extent be adjusted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The frequency and locations of lymph node metastases remain consistent post-NACT, with more involved nodes found in clinical non-responders. Accordingly, an extensive systemic lymphadenectomy is warranted for all patients treated with NACT and surgery regardless of the response.","Does neoadjuvant chemotherapy change how far lymphadenectomy should extend in cervical cancer cases? NACT does not impact the frequency or site distribution of lymph node metastases, and clinical non-responders show more lymph node involvement. Thus, a thorough systemic lymphadenectomy is necessary for patients receiving NACT plus surgery, no matter their response.","Could lymphadenectomy be tailored after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? The frequency and anatomical distribution of lymph node metastases remain unaffected by NACT; those not responding clinically display increased lymph node involvement. Therefore, all patients treated with NACT and surgery require systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy regardless of response.","Is neoadjuvant chemotherapy a factor in changing lymphadenectomy extent in cervical cancer? The occurrence and location of lymph node metastases do not vary with NACT, and clinical non-responders exhibit higher lymph node involvement. Hence, a systemic, extensive lymphadenectomy should be carried out for patients treated with NACT plus surgery, irrespective of treatment response.","Can the scope of lymphadenectomy be influenced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer? NACT does not modify the frequency or site-specific spread of lymph node metastases, and patients who fail to respond clinically have more involved nodes.
