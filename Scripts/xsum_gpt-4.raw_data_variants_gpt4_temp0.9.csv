"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid. They were close to reaching a target",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%.

"The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) said London's poorest children outperformed those in the north. The report is being launched by the government, indicating a stark educational inequality between the two regions.

"Muslim cleric Mehboob Akhtar, of Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced along with nine others including his wife and daughter. They were found guilty of a sophisticated benefit fraud scheme, resulting in the embezzlement of over £450,000 of taxpayer’s money. Investigations revealed that the group had submitted fraudulent applications for tax credits and other benefits over a span of five years.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate has been slashed by a significant percentage as part of a series of measures to boost a slowing economy. Economists predict this bold move may trigger a slew of similar cuts across the globe, potentially heralding a new era of competitive interest rate reductions.

Market watchers believe the surprise rate cut could serve as a strong stimulus for the struggling economy, providing much-needed liquidity and encouraging borrowing.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a ""disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum.""

This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities.

Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses.

The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector.

Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care.

A section of that ""prophecy"" was posted on the preacher's Facebook page but is no longer available. ""Ten days ago I saw the president of America with a narrow win... What I frankly saw was a woman,"" it said. TB Joshua has been trending on Twitter across Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa as people shared memes poking fun at his prediction.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 4.9%, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This static rate reflects the stability in the UK job market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. 

The numbers signify that the UK economy continues to display resilience, maintaining a relatively low level of unemployment. Economists have noted the robustness of the job market, attributing it to a combination of flexible working arrangements and sustained consumer spending. 

However, experts have also pointed out that while the overall unemployment figures are positive, they do not explicitly reflect the quality of work available. Underemployment and the prevalence of zero-hour contracts are ongoing issues, which the headline figures fail to address. 

These statistics underpin the complex reality of the job market, which, while demonstrating overall strength and stability, also reveals areas that require significant improvement.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than their two weeks statutory leave.

"The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are ""unfair"". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's ""shambolic mishandling"" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: ""One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. ""They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,"" he added. ""We are actually bringing down the hours that they work.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday. The one-year lending rate will also be reduced from 6% to 5.6%.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy owners to potentially evade tax obligations. 

The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to potentially dodge tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly leading the probe, which could hold significant implications for global finance. 

Bearer bonds, which were outlawed in the US in 1982 due to their use in money laundering and tax evasion, are still legal in other countries, including Switzerland. Critics argue that these unregistered securities are a loophole in tax law that primarily benefits the ultra-wealthy. 

The investigation comes amid increased efforts by US authorities to crack down on offshore tax evasion.

"The hashtag #penuriecarburantdansunfilm, which translates as ""fuel shortage in a film"", became France's top Twitter trend on Tuesday, with more than 5,000 tweets. A strike over new labour laws is now affecting all of France's eight oil refineries. An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies. In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road. American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious),",human,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Tom Wood. This has left coach Eddie Jones scrambling for options before their Six Nations championship clash against Scotland. 

The RFU confirmed on Monday that Haskell, Jones, Williams, and Wood have all picked up injuries during training. Haskell and Williams suffered foot injuries, Sam Jones sustained a fractured leg, while Wood is nursing a shoulder injury. 

The injury crisis is a huge blow for England, who have been enjoying a solid run in the Six Nations Championship. This comes as an unexpected disruption to their preparation, which had been focused on maintaining their unbeaten run in the championship.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies.

According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients.

The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a minimum dress code, and proof of right to work in the UK, from taxi drivers in an effort to improve services and enhance safety for passengers.

The proposed tests would be an addition to the already rigorous requirements set by the TfL for taxi drivers, including a topographical test and a medical check. The English language test is aimed to ensure that drivers can effectively communicate with passengers, while the map-reading assessment is designed to improve navigational skills. The introduction of a minimum dress code is to maintain a professional image, whereas the proof of right to work in the UK is a measure to comply with immigration laws.

"The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked from City Hospital last week, triggering a wave of outrage among their colleagues. The nurses' union argues that the two were merely defending themselves against an aggressive patient, who is known to have a history of violent behavior and mental health issues.

This dismissal, they contend, sets a dangerous precedent and underscores a lack of support for the staff's safety.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but recent developments have urged a reconsideration of the case. The Mcleod family has long suspected foul play, alleging a cover-up by the local police force.

The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) has now decided to reopen the case, following numerous appeals by the family and the emergence of new evidence. A fresh autopsy report suggests that Mcleod could have suffered internal injuries before drowning, contradicting the initial findings of accidental death by drowning.

The SPA has expressed its commitment to a comprehensive review of the case. They hope their efforts will provide the family with the answers they have sought for over two decades and potentially bring to light any misconduct or negligence that may have occurred.

"The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used to transfer various interfaces onto tabletops, walls, or even your own hand. 

This groundbreaking technology is paving the way for a new era of interactivity, propelling us towards a future where physical devices may become obsolete. The practical applications are endless, from providing musicians with portable, easily customizable instruments to offering a more immersive and flexible workspace for professionals.

The laser projector works by emitting a grid of infrared beams. When the user interacts with the projected interface, the beams are interrupted, and the system can calculate the exact location of the interaction. For instance, each faux piano key or button pressed on a projected keyboard can correspond to a specific note or command.

Albeit still in its early stages, this technology has the potential to revolutionize our interaction with digital media. It promises to make our everyday tasks more efficient, flexible, and remarkably futuristic.
