"The 71-year-old won 60.75% of the vote while his nearest rival Kizza Besigye took 35%, the election commission has announced. The 71-year-old, President Yoweri Museveni, has retained his position as the head of Uganda, following a contentious election. The victory has extended his rule into a fourth decade, with this marking his sixth term in office.

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin cargoes without guarantees that port fees will be paid. However, creditors, banks and the South Korean government are all reluctant to put up the cash. The global economic downturn, fierce competition and falling prices has hit profits across the cargo shipping industry and Hanjin collapsed with debts of about $5.4bn (Â£4.1bn) last month. There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors. The ships contain everything from computer parts to perishable food with many of the cargoes destined for the Christmas market in the US and Europe.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, one of the country's most active, has seen a significant upsurge in activity in recent months, raising concerns among scientists about a potential major eruption.

They warn that the current increase in activity could potentially lead to a large-scale eruption, threatening the nearby city of Kagoshima and its 600,000 inhabitants.

The researchers' concerns are built on a combination of seismic data, ground deformation and gas emission measurements. In particular, the alarming rate of ground swelling around the volcano indicates a significant increase in magma supply.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%. That's a slightly better prediction but the principal, Prof Peter Finn, says that is still far too challenging.

But the main Syrian opposition group, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), voiced strong reservations, stating that the agreement is more likely to freeze the conflict while allowing continued government attacks on opposition-held areas. 

They express their skepticism over the effectiveness of the ""de-escalation zones,"" citing Russia and Iran's track-record of not honoring previous ceasefires. They fear this deal could be an attempt by Moscow to solidify President Bashar al-Assad's control over swathes of Syria. 

In response, Russia insists that the zones will lead to a cessation of hostilities and improve the humanitarian situation.

He had been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia under strict conditions. The Associated Press reported his release to his mother's home on Saturday.

"The cut, which took the markets by surprise, was the first since 2012, and comes into effect on Saturday.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been annually disbursed to Northern Ireland's universities. The special premium, usually reserved for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, has been described by Dr Farry as a ""disincentive for universities to broaden their curriculum.""

This decision arrives amidst a backdrop of continuing funding issues and budget concerns plaguing the higher education sector in Northern Ireland. The minister hopes the removal of this premium will encourage universities to diversify their course offerings, particularly in the arts and humanities.

Critics of Dr Farry's decision argue it could inadvertently damage the prospects of STEM students, whose subjects are often more costly to deliver. However, Dr Farry insists that the general block grant for universities will not be affected and that the institutions would still have sufficient resources to maintain and invest in STEM courses.

The move is consistent with the minister’s previous insistence on a more balanced higher education sector. Whether the change will bring the desired effect in broadening the curriculum remains to be seen.",ai,"Dr. Stephen Farry, the Employment and Learning minister, has chosen to eliminate a special premium payment of Â£1.1 million that has been annually distributed to Northern Ireland's universities.

"The company said it had been cleared by government officials in Senegal to launch an evaluation plan. Cairn, which made two significant discoveries in the area, has been given the green light to further assess the full potential of its key assets.

This follows the successful drilling of two exploration wells in Senegal, both yielding considerable amounts of hydrocarbon reserves. The study will focus on determining the commercial viability of these resources, which could potentially fortify Senegal's nascent oil industry.

The approval comes as a major boost for Cairn, reinforcing their status as a leading player in the region's burgeoning oil sector. If the evaluation confirms previous estimates, Cairn could be sitting on one of the largest oilfields in West Africa.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than ""A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off to spend time with their newborns, suggesting that workplace cultures and policies may pose a critical barrier to parental involvement in early child care.

The survey, which involved over 1,000 participants across various job sectors, reflected a persistent stigma associated with paternity leave. Many new fathers reported feeling pressured to return to work due to concerns about job security, income stability, and perceptions of traditional gender roles.

The findings highlight a need for a paradigm shift in corporate attitudes towards paternity leave. Experts argue that encouraging fathers to take their full leave can have significant benefits, not only for the child's development and the mother's postpartum recovery but also for the overall productivity and morale of employees. It's time for businesses to reassess their policies and culture and contribute proactively to nurturing an equitable workforce.",ai,"A survey of employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave, and less than 10% took more than two weeks off to care for their newborns, indicating that workplace culture and policies may hinder early parental involvement.","According to a survey involving over 1,000 workers, a quarter of new fathers skipped paternity leave entirely, while fewer than one in ten took more than two weeks, suggesting that workplace norms and policies create significant barriers to fathers' participation in early childcare.","The survey, which included employees and managers from various sectors, found that 25% of new fathers took no paternity leave, and under 10% took more than two weeks, pointing to workplace culture and policies as obstacles to active fatherhood during early child care.","Findings from a survey of over 1,000 employees and managers showed that a quarter of new fathers did not take any paternity leave, and less than 10% took more than two weeks off, highlighting how workplace environments may restrict fathers' involvement with their newborns.","A study surveying employees and managers found that 25% of new fathers avoided paternity leave altogether, with fewer than 10% taking more than two weeks, suggesting that workplace culture and policies may limit early paternal engagement.","The survey results, gathered from more than 1,000 participants, indicate that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave, and fewer than 10% took over two weeks, implying that workplace attitudes and policies are a key barrier to fathers' early childcare involvement.","Research involving employees and managers found that one in four new fathers took no paternity leave, and less than 10% took more than two weeks, pointing to workplace culture and policies as critical obstacles to paternal participation in early child care.","A survey of over 1,000 employees and managers revealed that 25% of new fathers did not take any paternity leave, and fewer than 10% took more than two weeks, suggesting that workplace culture and policies hinder fathers' early involvement with their newborns.","The survey, conducted across various job sectors, found that a quarter of new fathers skipped paternity leave entirely, and fewer than one in ten took more than two weeks, indicating that workplace culture and policies may be significant barriers to early father involvement.","Data from a survey of employees and managers showed that 25% of new fathers took no paternity leave at all, and fewer than 10% took more than two weeks, highlighting workplace culture and policies as obstacles to early paternal engagement."

"It means instead of people owning cars and bikes, one version of the future is we all hire transport to get around.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house, signalling a significant shift from Japan's post-war pacifism and marking a milestone in its military normalization. The bill, if approved by the upper house, would extend Japan's military options by ending a ban on exercising collective self-defense, or aiding an ally under attack. While supporters argue that it is crucial for Japan to strengthen its role in global security amid growing regional threats, the move has triggered widespread protests from citizens and constitutional scholars who contend it violates Japan's constitution and could potentially embroil the country in U.S.-led conflicts around the globe. This legislation is a reflection of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push for Japan to take on a more assertive military posture, a stance that has raised eyebrows within the international community.",ai,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT,FAILED_VARIANT

"Ben Butler met a psychologist in 2004 after assaulting a man in a nightclub.

"Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the force had ""fragile"" staffing levels and needed to ""implement more robust human resource strategies.""

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) has issued a stark warning about frailty in police staffing levels, stating that the force currently operates with ""fragile"" staffing levels and needs to ""implement more robust human resource strategies."" This recent assessment has thrown light on the intensifying pressure faced by law enforcement agencies around the country, which are grappling with budget cuts and rising crime rates.

The Inspectorate called for immediate action to address the issue, suggesting that workforce planning and recruitment efforts are not keeping pace with the departure or retirement of experienced staff. HMIC emphasized that higher quality leadership and management, coupled with the implementation of a more strategic workforce plan, can help to stave off the staffing crisis.

Public safety is potentially at risk if these concerns are not addressed promptly. The HMIC's findings serve as an urgent call to action for the police forces to bolster their ranks and ensure the public's trust in their ability to maintain law and order.",ai,"Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) reported that the police force has ""fragile"" staffing levels and must ""implement more robust human resource strategies.""","The HMIC warned that the police force is operating with ""fragile"" staffing numbers and needs to adopt stronger human resource strategies.","According to HMIC, the force's staffing is ""fragile"" and requires the implementation of more effective human resource strategies.","HMIC highlighted that the police force currently has ""fragile"" staffing and must develop more resilient human resource strategies.","The Inspectorate stated that staffing levels are ""fragile"" and called for the force to ""implement more robust human resource strategies.""","Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary indicated that the force's staffing is ""fragile"" and urged the adoption of improved human resource strategies.","HMIC has identified ""fragile"" staffing levels within the force and stressed the need for better human resource strategies.","The police force is described by HMIC as having ""fragile"" staffing levels and requiring stronger human resource strategies.","HMIC emphasized that the force's staffing situation is ""fragile"" and that more robust human resource strategies must be put in place.","The Inspectorate has warned that the force's staffing is ""fragile"" and called for the implementation of enhanced human resource strategies."
"Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to restore and revitalize the native woodland environment. 

The initiative, supported by the Scottish Natural Heritage, aims to combat the continuous deforestation that has plagued the country and foster a more sustainable ecology. Rehabilitation of the woodland through planting acorns will bring back the natural biodiversity that once thrived in these areas.

Not only will the project aid in environmental recuperation, but it will also provide a habitat for local wildlife, particularly endangered species who rely on the forest ecosystem for survival. It is expected that the reforestation will attract a range of fauna, from birds to mammals, contributing to a more balanced ecosystem.

Furthermore, the initiative will provide an educational opportunity for the local community, allowing them to engage with nature in a meaningful and hands-on way.

Retired West Indies international Chanderpaul put on 55 with Ryan McLaren, calming the innings after the early wickets, before the 42-year-old was joined by Clark when Gareth Batty dismissed McLaren.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms."" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would ""slip through the net"".

The Port Talbot-based Specific Innovation Centre is working on the revolutionary concept of ""buildings as power stations"". An ambitious project, it is a collaborative effort involving Tata Steel, Swansea University and AkzoNobel, aiming to create a sustainable future for the construction industry.

At its core, the project aims to develop buildings that can generate, store, and release their own solar energy. This innovative approach to energy production and consumption could transform the way we perceive and use buildings.

Tata Steel provides the building materials, Swansea University brings its expertise in solar energy research, while AkzoNobel, a global paint and coatings company, ensures the buildings are not only energy efficient but aesthetically pleasing as well.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 4.9%, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This static rate reflects the stability in the UK job market, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. 

The numbers signify that the UK economy continues to display resilience, maintaining a relatively low level of unemployment. Economists have noted the robustness of the job market, attributing it to a combination of flexible working arrangements and sustained consumer spending.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn. But they still represent only 1% of holdings by global financial institutions, he said.

"The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy owners to potentially evade tax obligations. 

The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so-called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy individuals to potentially dodge tax obligations. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are reportedly leading the probe, which could hold significant implications for global finance.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were spotted in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania, by a group of wildlife photographers who couldn't believe their eyes.

Experts claim it is rare for a lioness to nurse another's offspring, let alone from another species. This rare interspecies interaction has captured the hearts of wildlife enthusiasts across the globe.

Scientists from the WildCRU at Oxford University have suggested that the unusual relationship could be the result of the lioness’ strong maternal instincts. The leopard cub, possibly orphaned or abandoned, has found an unlikely savior.

The police were informed about the incident following a report from the college. After a thorough investigation, they concluded that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a criminal prosecution.

"The care at Stafford Hospital left some patients drinking water from vases, it is claimed, and receptionists assessing emergency cases. Julie Bailey, who founded the Cure the NHS group after the death of her mother at the hospital in 2007, said that the levels of neglect were horrifying.

"England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Tom Wood. This has left coach Eddie Jones scrambling for options before their Six Nations championship clash against Scotland. 

The RFU confirmed on Monday that Haskell, Jones, Williams, and Wood have all picked up injuries during training. Haskell and Williams suffered foot injuries, Sam Jones sustained a fractured leg, while Wood is nursing a shoulder injury. 

The injury crisis is a huge blow for England, who have been enjoying a solid run in the Six Nations Championship. This comes as an unexpected disruption to their preparation, which had been focused on maintaining their unbeaten run in the championship. 

Despite the setback, Coach Eddie Jones seemed optimistic. ""We have depth in the squad, which will allow other players to step up,"" he said.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but his family believe that injuries on his body showed that he was murdered. An assessment was done of ""all information known"" regarding the death after contact between his family and chief constable Phil Gormley. Police said the review had included tracing and speaking to people who were in Wick the night Mr Mcleod died, but who had not previously come forward. Mr Mcleod's mother, June, told BBC Scotland last month that if the assessment ""turned up nothing new"" she and her family would continue to fight for a fresh investigation.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales have been identified in a recent research study conducted by the College of Policing. The findings suggest that officers were primarily focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other significant risk factors. This bias towards violent offences may be compromising the efficacy of policing in these areas, potentially leaving citizens vulnerable to other types of crime.

The research highlighted the need for deeper insights and broader scopes in threat assessments to ensure comprehensive law enforcement. The three unnamed police forces have reportedly taken the findings on board and are now reassessing their approaches to address this issue.

The findings also urge for improved training and resource allocation, particularly for areas of crime that may not involve violence but are equally detrimental, such as cybercrime, fraud, and drug offenses.

"Sterling rose 1.86% against the dollar to $1.32.40, and was 1.73% higher against the euro, marking its strongest performance in over a year. This surge has been attributed to a combination of factors, including continued post-Brexit optimism and stronger than anticipated economic data.

Analysts attribute the bullish sentiment around the sterling to the recent release of robust UK employment figures, which revealed a surprising resilience in the job market despite pandemic-related challenges.

"The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The union's recent actions have sparked a heated debate about the future of healthcare in the United Kingdom, raising questions about the role of medical professionals in shaping health policies.

According to critics, the refusal by the union to engage in constructive dialogue is hindering efforts to streamline processes, enhance patient satisfaction, and ultimately improve health outcomes. They argue that the union's stance is primarily driven by self-interest, rather than the welfare of patients.

The union, however, has denied these allegations, maintaining that their primary concern is the welfare of both patients and doctors. They argue that they are being unfairly targeted and scapegoated for larger systemic issues within the NHS.

The highest economic impact was observed in Syria, where the cost of violence is estimated at 60% of its GDP. These figures underline the urgent need for peace and stability to enable sustainable economic development.

"Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, a minimum dress code, and proof of right to work in the UK, from taxi drivers in an effort to improve services and enhance safety for passengers. This comes as an initiative to address a number of issues that have been raised by passengers and the taxi industry.

The proposed tests would be an addition to the already rigorous requirements set by the TfL for taxi drivers, including a topographical test and a medical check. The English language test is aimed to ensure that drivers can effectively communicate with passengers, while the map-reading assessment is designed to improve navigational skills. The introduction of a minimum dress code is to maintain a professional image, whereas the proof of right to work in the UK is a measure to comply with immigration laws.

These changes are expected to raise the standard of service provided by taxi drivers in London and enhance passengers' overall experience.

"The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient.

"Among them was a 17-year-old stopped at Sydney airport a fortnight ago, said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. Mr Dutton said there were increasing concerns about the number of Australian teenagers being radicalized and trying to join extremist groups overseas. The 17-year-old, whose identity has been withheld due to privacy laws, was stopped under Operation Rampart, a joint initiative by the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, aimed at identifying and deterring individuals from travelling overseas to participate in hostile activities. 

Mr. Dutton warned that extremist groups were actively targeting vulnerable young Australians online, leveraging their sense of isolation or grievances to push radical ideologies. The incident underscores the ongoing threat of homegrown extremism, in a country that has largely been insulated from the global scourge of terrorism.

The Minister urged parents and guardians to keep a vigilant eye on the online activities of their children, raising awareness of the risks associated with radicalisation.

"Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour in February 1997. The 24-year-old's death was treated as accidental, but recent developments have urged a reconsideration of the case. The Mcleod family has long suspected foul play, alleging a cover-up by the local police force.

The Scottish Police Authority (SPA) has now decided to reopen the case, following numerous appeals by the family and the emergence of new evidence. A fresh autopsy report suggests that Mcleod could have suffered internal injuries before drowning, contradicting the initial findings of accidental death by drowning.

The Mcleod family's relentless pursuit for justice and the new autopsy findings have sparked a nationwide conversation about accountability and transparency in law enforcement agencies.

The SPA has expressed its commitment to a comprehensive review of the case. They hope their efforts will provide the family with the answers they have sought for over two decades and potentially bring to light any misconduct or negligence that may have occurred.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 5.1%, the ONS said. There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year.

"The interactive display can replicate the phone's touch screen, a full-size computer keyboard or even piano keys. The laser projector can also be used to transfer various interfaces onto tabletops, walls, or even your own hand. 

This groundbreaking technology is paving the way for a new era of interactivity, propelling us towards a future where physical devices may become obsolete. The practical applications are endless, from providing musicians with portable, easily customizable instruments to offering a more immersive and flexible workspace for professionals.

The laser projector works by emitting a grid of infrared beams. When the user interacts with the projected interface, the beams are interrupted, and the system can calculate the exact location of the interaction. For instance, each faux piano key or button pressed on a projected keyboard can correspond to a specific note or command.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say.
