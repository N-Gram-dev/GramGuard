"Mr Joshua told his congregation on Sunday that he ""saw"" a woman winning. After Donald Trump convincingly won Tuesday's vote, visitors to the preacher's website were met with a curious update.  Instead of admitting a mistaken prophecy, Mr. Joshua's team claimed the ""woman"" was actually the American people, and that Trump's victory marked a new chapter for the nation.

This explanation, however, failed to resonate with many, particularly those who had been convinced by Mr. Joshua's previous pronouncements.  The incident has raised questions about the legitimacy of prophetic claims and the expectations placed upon self-proclaimed seers. Some have suggested that the ambiguity of Mr. Joshua's vision allows him to reinterpret events to suit his narrative, while others see it as a simple case of miscalculation.

"##  Diamonds Stolen in Daring Airport Heist

Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the gems. The daring heist, which took place at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport, saw thieves make off with a large quantity of diamonds worth an estimated $20 million.

The former councilor, now running for re-election, faced questions about his connection to ""Homes for All,"" a non-profit organization he served on the board of directors for.

"## London's Red Buses Get a Makeover: Engine Removal Proposed for 142 Idle Vehicles

The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal, which will be discussed at the next council meeting, could reach £1 million annually. The initiative, driven by the city's environmental and budgetary concerns, would see the repurposed buses used for static purposes, like advertising or mobile libraries. Critics argue the plan could negatively impact London's tourism industry, which relies on the iconic red buses. Proponents, however, believe the change is necessary to adapt to changing needs and prioritize sustainability. The decision will likely be a hotly contested one, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.

"## TfL Proposes New Driver Tests: Language, Navigation, and Landline Required

Transport for London (TfL) is to consult on plans to demand a new English language test, a map-reading assessment, and a fixed landline telephone for all new driving licence applications. The proposed changes, aimed at enhancing road safety and driver competence, have sparked debate. 

The English language test would assess comprehension of road signs and traffic regulations, while the map-reading assessment aims to combat reliance on GPS navigation. The requirement for a fixed landline phone is intended to improve communication in emergencies, particularly in areas with limited mobile reception. 

The consultation period, open until [date], invites public feedback on the proposed changes and their potential impact on accessibility and affordability.

The driver was surprised to see the rear of the stationary train so close to the west end of platform six."

"Midfielder Arteta, 32, had a bony spur removed from his left ankle, which the club said has been causing him ""significant discomfort"" for months. Defender Debuchy, who just returned from three months out with an ankle injury, had an operation on a shoulder he dislocated in the win over Stoke. Boss Arsene Wenger described Debuchy's injury on Sunday as ""unbelievable"". ""It's very unfortunate,"" said the Frenchman. ""It's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again."" Debuchy has played just 14 times since signing from Newcastle in July in a deal worth a reported £12m. With Kieran Gibbs recovering from an inflamed heel, 19-year-old Hector Bellerin or Calum Chambers may deputise against Manchester City on Sunday. Arsenal took the decision to send Arteta for surgery to preserve his long-term fitness. The Spaniard last played on 26 November in a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund.

"## Thai Parliament Approves Controversial Amnesty Bill

The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning, sparking protests and raising concerns about the potential for impunity. 

The bill, which aims to reconcile the country after years of political instability, covers a wide range of offences, including those related to the 2010 Red Shirt protests and the 2014 military coup. Critics argue that it would allow for the return of exiled politicians, including Mr Thaksin, and could shield those responsible for human rights abuses. 

Supporters, however, maintain that the amnesty is necessary to move the country forward and bring about national unity. The bill now faces a vote in the Senate, with its fate uncertain.

"The Crawick Multiverse, designed by renowned artist Charles Jencks, has been created with materials found on the site in Dumfries and Galloway. The ambitious project, inspired by the principles of cosmology and the interconnectedness of the universe, transforms a former opencast coal mine into a landscape of dramatic earthworks and reflective pools. 

Jencks, known for his groundbreaking work in architectural theory and landscape design, envisioned the Crawick Multiverse as a place of contemplation and wonder. Visitors can wander through the labyrinthine pathways, explore the different ""universes"" represented by the unique earthworks, and reflect on the vastness of space and time.

"## Sunak Accuses Doctors' Union of Spreading ""Misinformation"" 

The doctors' union had refused to sit down and talk about improving patient care and had spread ""misinformation"", he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Chancellor Rishi Sunak faced criticism this morning for his handling of the ongoing dispute with the British Medical Association (BMA).  In a heated interview, Sunak accused the BMA of ""playing politics"" and refusing to engage in ""constructive dialogue"" about addressing the current NHS crisis.  He reiterated his offer of a 7% pay increase over the next two years, emphasizing it was the ""fairest and most sustainable"" solution.  However, the BMA insists that this offer falls short of the necessary 30% pay rise to address the years of real-terms pay cuts and the current staffing shortages plaguing the NHS.  The ongoing deadlock threatens further disruption to patient care, with the BMA planning further strikes in the coming months.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

"The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the Welsh Government would be consulted on the matter, but there was no requirement for a referendum.  

The party has been accused of breaking its manifesto promise, with opposition parties calling for an immediate referendum. The party has defended its decision, saying that it is in the best interests of the Welsh people.

The funding floor is a controversial policy, with some arguing that it will help to protect public services in Wales. Others have argued that it will lead to a reduction in funding for vital services. 

The debate is likely to continue, with both sides of the argument making their case in the coming months.

"## New Dads Still Missing Out on Paternity Leave, Survey Finds

A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than the minimum legally mandated time off. The findings highlight a continued reluctance amongst new dads to prioritize their own wellbeing and the bonding period with their newborns.  

Experts cite a range of factors contributing to this trend, including societal expectations around masculinity, concerns about job security, and inadequate workplace policies. They emphasize the importance of encouraging men to take advantage of paternity leave, arguing that it benefits not only the father, but the entire family and workplace. The survey calls for increased awareness and support for new fathers, urging employers to foster a culture that normalizes and encourages paternity leave.

"The site is believed to contain thousands of copies of a video game called ET The Extra-Terrestrial. A company called Atari made the game in 1982, and it was a commercial flop.

Some people hope that the cartridges can be sold for a profit, while others hope that they will be donated to museums.

"## Nurses Walk Out in Protest Over Sackings Following Patient Struggle 

The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient. Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite colleagues claiming they acted in self-defense. The incident occurred at St. Mary's Hospital on Tuesday, where a patient reportedly became aggressive and violent.  Witnesses say Gregson and Hilton were injured during the struggle, but were later dismissed for allegedly using excessive force. 

The nurses' union, the Royal College of Nursing, has condemned the dismissals, calling them ""unjustified"" and ""unfair."" The union is now calling for an independent investigation into the incident and the subsequent sackings. The walkout, which began at 8am this morning, has caused significant disruption to services at St. Mary's. Patients are being redirected to other hospitals, and elective surgeries have been postponed. It is unclear how long the walkout will continue.

"## Injury Crisis Hits England Back Row Ahead of Crucial Test

England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile Maro Ito. The injuries come at a crucial time for the team, who are preparing for their upcoming Test matches.

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency.

"## Japan Approves Historic Legislation Allowing Troops to Fight Abroad

The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two. The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the upper house, represents a significant shift in Japan's post-war security policy. It would allow the country's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to engage in collective self-defense, meaning they could fight alongside allies even if Japan itself is not directly attacked.

The legislation has sparked controversy, with some arguing it will increase the risk of Japan being dragged into foreign conflicts. Others, however, see it as a necessary step to bolster Japan's security in a rapidly changing regional landscape. The move comes amid growing tensions in the East China Sea, where Japan and China have overlapping territorial claims.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms."" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would ""slip through the net"". In response, the College of Policing is setting up a pilot scheme to help officers identify possible patterns of abusive behaviour.

"## Google Assistant Expands Beyond Pixel Phones, Now Available on Samsung Galaxy Devices

Until now, Google Assistant had only been available on the firm's own Pixel phones. The service, like Siri on iPhones, allows users to interact with their device using voice commands, making tasks like setting alarms, sending messages, and controlling smart home devices effortless. But in a significant move, Google has announced the expansion of Assistant's reach, making it available on Samsung Galaxy devices starting today. 

This move marks a major shift in the voice assistant landscape, opening up a whole new market for Google Assistant.

"## Orange Order Parade Limited Again in Belfast 

**Belfast, Northern Ireland** - As with last year's parade, only the Orangemen and their 13 notified bands can march past St Patrick's Church on Donegall Street this year. The decision, announced by the Parades Commission, comes following a series of protests and tensions surrounding the annual Orange Order march in the city. 

The Parades Commission stated that the decision was made to ""minimize the risk of public disorder"" and ""protect the rights of all communities."" This decision has been met with mixed reactions, with some expressing disappointment and others welcoming it as a step toward reconciliation.

"##  Rwenzururu King's Medical Privileges Sparks Controversy 

Charles Mumbere, the king of Rwenzururu, is entitled to these privileges because he suffers from hypertension and diabetes, it added. But the decision to grant him access to a private hospital for treatment has sparked controversy. Critics argue that Mumbere, who is facing charges of treason and murder, should be treated in a public hospital like any other prisoner. 

The government has defended its decision, stating that Mumbere's health condition requires specialized care available only at the designated facility. However, the move has fueled concerns about unequal access to healthcare and potential preferential treatment for high-profile individuals. The debate is expected to intensify as Mumbere's trial continues.

There were 31.58 million people in work, up 44,000 from the previous quarter. That took the employment rate to a record high of 74.2%. But the number of job vacancies dropped by 18,000 to 745,000, the ONS added, marking the first fall for almost a year. David Freeman, a senior statistician at the ONS, said: ""The employment rate has hit another record high, but this time the increase is quite modest. ""With unemployment very little changed, that is further evidence the jobs market could be cooling off."" Average earnings including bonuses rose 2% from a year earlier, up from 1.9% in the three months to February. The ONS said the timing of bonuses this year had affected the rise in total earnings. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.1% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 2.2% in the three months to February.

The event was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the shootings, which remain a source of controversy and pain for the community.  The four men, who were all unarmed, were shot dead by soldiers who claimed they were carrying weapons.  However, no weapons were ever found at the scene.  The victims were identified as John McKerr, Brian Friel, Charles McElvogue and Eugene Kelly.  Their families have been campaigning for justice for decades, and the event on Thursday was a chance for them to remember their loved ones and to call for a full and independent inquiry into the shootings.

The families of the men were joined by local politicians and community leaders at the event.  They heard speeches from speakers who called for an end to the cycle of violence and for a more peaceful future.  The event was also a reminder of the ongoing pain and suffering caused by the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

The review is expected to consider the BBC's funding model, its role in the media landscape, and its future in a digital world. S4C, which is funded by the BBC, is likely to be affected by any changes made to the BBC's funding. 

The Welsh language broadcaster has already faced funding cuts in recent years, and some have expressed concern that the review could lead to further cuts or even the closure of the channel.

"The party's 54 sitting MPs are expected to be endorsed as candidates. A decision will also be made about the fate of Natalie McGarry and Michelle Thomson, who were elected as SNP MPs but now sit as independent members. Labour's executive is also expected to decide candidate selection, while some challengers have come forward for the Conservatives and Lib Dems already. The UK goes to the polls on 8 June after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans for a snap election, subsequently endorsed by MPs by 552 votes to 13. Ms McGarry and Ms Thomson were the only two Scottish MPs to vote against the election, with SNP members abstaining. If they do not return, the SNP will need to find five candidates, including three for the seats the party did not win in 2015. A number of party activists have already announced their intention to bid for the SNP ticket in the Glasgow East and Edinburgh West seats formerly occupied by the two women. On Friday, the UK Labour party issued a call for prospective for parliamentary candidates over Twitter, inviting party members to apply with a deadline of noon on Sunday.

"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0. The bill's passage through the Senate is less certain, reports the BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, as half its members are appointed. But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics say the amnesty would allow human rights abuses to go unpunished.

"## Newsweek Goes Digital: Print Edition to End After 85 Years

The last print edition of Newsweek will be on 31 December, reflecting the trend for newspapers and magazines to move online as traditional advertising declines. Newsweek merged with The Daily Beast in 2010, and the combined entity will continue to publish online and in mobile formats.

“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, which owns The Daily Beast. “The print advertising market is simply not sustainable for a weekly news magazine.” 

The move marks the end of an era for the iconic magazine, which was founded in 1933 and has won numerous awards for its journalism. However, Newsweek's online presence has grown significantly in recent years, with a strong following on social media. The company hopes to reach a wider audience by focusing on digital platforms.

"Disguised as police, they broke through a fence on Monday evening and broke into the cargo of a Swiss-bound plane to take the gems, estimated to be worth $50m (Â£32m; 37m euros). They escaped back through the same hole. Police later found a burned-out vehicle close to the airport. Police are looking for eight men, a prosecutors' spokeswoman said. Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: ""What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum."" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery ""one of the biggest"" ever. She said that the diamonds were ""rough stones"" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich.

"##  Children's Stories Reveal Growing Anxiety About Climate Change

OUP analysed more than 120,421 short stories by children aged between five and 13 years old, submitted to the Oxford University Press's annual ""Write Your World"" competition. The results reveal a stark trend: a significant increase in children's anxieties surrounding climate change. 

Nearly 40% of the stories featured themes of environmental destruction, pollution, and the impact of climate change on the natural world.

"## Climate Change Costs Could Top $178 Trillion by 2100, New Report Warns

That amount is equivalent to the combined economies of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, the report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) revealed. The report, titled ""The Economic Impacts of Climate Change,"" paints a stark picture of the potential economic devastation wrought by climate change if immediate and drastic action isn't taken. 

The IEP analysis predicts that global GDP could decline by 7.2% by 2100, primarily due to decreased productivity and increased costs associated with extreme weather events. The report urges governments and businesses to prioritize green investments and implement robust climate change adaptation strategies to mitigate these devastating consequences.

"## Historic Lyndhurst Park Hotel Facing Demolition for Luxury Flats

The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling and visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson, is facing demolition. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with a luxury retirement village, sparking outrage from heritage campaigners. 

The hotel, built in the 18th century, sits in a picturesque location near Lymington, Hampshire. It has been a popular destination for centuries, attracting notable figures such as Stevenson, who stayed there in the 1880s. However, the building has fallen into disrepair and has been empty for several years.

PegasusLife argues that the development will ""provide much-needed housing for the elderly"" and create jobs. However, heritage groups have condemned the plans, calling the hotel ""a vital part of local history"" and urging for its preservation. A public consultation is underway, and the fate of the Lyndhurst Park Hotel remains uncertain.
