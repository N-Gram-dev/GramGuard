"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a ""game changer"" on energy: not only for buildings to become self-sufficient but for surplus energy to be stored and to supply the grid.

Conversely, the availability of workers fell further, evidencing the sharpest fall in permanent staff availability in nine months, and Scotland’s temporary recruitment pools shrinking at the quickest pace in almost two years. The greatest demand growth for permanent hires came in IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering sectors, with lasting high demand for nursing/medical/care and IT roles.","In April, the recent Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland identified marked increases in both permanent and temporary job placements, with temporary staffing demand growing at its highest level in nearly 10 years. However, recruiters cautioned that dwindling candidate availability threatens these gains, as employers encounter difficulties sourcing the necessary skills. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) stressed the importance that whichever party forms government after the 8 June general election must protect foreign worker access and expand investment in UK jobseekers. The report found that growth in permanent hiring continued for the third month in a row in April, at the fastest pace in 21 months, contrasting with a wider UK slowdown. Temporary placements also surged, posting the steepest rise since August 2014. Worker availability overall, however, dropped further in April, with permanent staff availability declining at the sharpest rate in nine months, and the availability of Scottish temporary candidates shrinking at the fastest pace in almost two years. According to the report, IT and computing, nursing/medical/care, and hotel and catering were the sectors seeing highest growth in permanent staff demand, while nursing/medical/care and IT led in temporary staff demand."

The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, which has been active for over 70 years, has been exhibiting increased activity in recent years, prompting concerns about a potential large-scale eruption.

This increased seismicity, combined with rising ground deformation, is indicative of a heightened risk of eruption.

Sakurajima is located approximately 50 kilometers from the city of Kagoshima, home to over half a million people.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%.

"The deal unveiled by Russia on Thursday to set up four ""de-escalation zones"" is backed by Turkey and Iran. But the main Syrian opposition groups have expressed skepticism and concerns over the effectiveness of this agreement.

The aim of these de-escalation zones is to reduce violence and create a safe environment for civilians in Syria. However, opposition groups fear that this deal could further divide the country and consolidate the power of President Bashar al-Assad.

The four zones are located in rebel-held areas: Idlib province, parts of Homs province, Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, and the south of the country. While these areas have been heavily targeted by government forces, the opposition argues that the deal fails to address the root causes of the conflict.

Furthermore, there are concerns about the monitoring and enforcement of this agreement. Despite Russia, Turkey, and Iran's involvement, opposition groups are skeptical about their commitment to protecting civilians and ensuring the ceasefire holds.

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of £1.1m which it was awarding to a specific group of workers. The premium payment, known as the Additional Duties Allowance (ADA), was being given to support staff in the education sector, including caretakers, classroom assistants, and administrative staff.

The decision to remove the ADA has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters of the move argue that the funds can be better utilized elsewhere, such as improving educational resources or investing in teacher training. They believe that the ADA was an unnecessary expense that did not directly contribute to the quality of education.

"A survey of employees and managers found that a quarter of new fathers took no paternity leave at all. Fewer than one in 10 took more than two weeks off work to spend time with their newborn child. The survey, conducted by a leading human resources consultancy firm, shed light on the alarming lack of support and understanding for new fathers in the workplace.

The study revealed that many fathers felt pressured to return to work quickly due to fear of repercussions or negative perceptions from colleagues and superiors. Additionally, a significant number of respondents cited financial concerns as a primary reason for not taking paternity leave, highlighting the need for more comprehensive family-friendly policies that address these issues.

Experts argue that the lack of paternity leave not only deprives fathers of crucial bonding time with their children but also perpetuates gender inequality within the workplace. By placing the burden of childcare solely on mothers, companies inadvertently reinforce traditional gender roles and hinder the progression towards a more equitable society.

The survey findings have sparked calls for employers to reassess their policies and offer more extensive and flexible paternity leave options.

"Stephen Parnaby, Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said the announcement was ""great news for the town and the wider East Riding"". The authority said it was spending about £100,000 on hosting the event. The organisers of last year's inaugural race said it brought £50m into the region's economy. The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. ""The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa £100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,"" he said. Others in Beverley have also welcomed the race's arrival. Local amateur cyclist Ed Neilson said he hoped having the start of the race would encourage other cyclists to visit the town.

"S4C gets most of its income from the licence fee and UK ministers have announced a major review of the BBC. Monmouth MP David Davies has called for a similar review of S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster. Davies argues that due to the changing media landscape, it is necessary to reassess S4C's remit and funding model.

S4C currently receives nearly 90% of its income from the licence fee, making it heavily reliant on this revenue stream. However, with the rise of streaming platforms and changing viewing habits, the future of the licence fee itself is uncertain.

He also suggests that a review of S4C's remit is necessary, considering the increasing availability of Welsh-language content on digital platforms.

"The party's election manifesto said a funding floor would only be introduced after a referendum was called. The St David's Day Agreement had said the vote would be held within six months of the manifesto's enactment. However, there seems to be a delay in calling for the referendum, as the party is facing opposition from various factions.

The funding floor proposal is aimed at ensuring fair and equal distribution of resources among regions. It aims to address the long-standing issue of funding disparities and promote economic growth in underdeveloped areas.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped that this initiative will alleviate the strain on primary care services and reduce the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.

The new service, known as ""Pharmacy First,"" allows patients with minor ailments to directly access advice and treatment from their local pharmacist, without the need for a doctor's appointment.

"The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two.

"The latest Markit Report on Jobs for Scotland found sharp rises in permanent and temporary job placements in April. Growth in temporary staff demand was also strong, reflecting a positive trend in Scotland's job market. According to the report, this surge in placements was driven by increased business confidence and a gradual reopening of the economy.

"Over the next few years Forest Enterprise Scotland will plant them around Loch Trool and the Cree Valley. It is hoped the acorns should help to regenerate the declining oak population in the area. Forest Enterprise Scotland has announced plans to plant thousands of oak trees in the picturesque surroundings of Loch Trool and the Cree Valley.

Over the next few years, Forest Enterprise Scotland will strategically distribute acorns in these areas, aiming to boost the dwindling oak numbers and restore the natural beauty of the landscape. The project is part of a wider effort to protect and enhance Scotland's native woodlands.

Oak trees are not only aesthetically pleasing but also play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity. They provide habitats for a wide range of wildlife and are vital for the survival of many species. However, in recent years, the oak population in the region has suffered due to various factors, including climate change and disease.

By planting acorns, Forest Enterprise Scotland hopes to create a sustainable ecosystem that will foster the growth of oak trees and encourage the return of diverse wildlife. This initiative aligns with the Scottish government's commitment to increase woodland coverage and combat biodiversity loss.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to take a leading role in providing long-term financing for green projects in emerging markets. Mr Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England, emphasized the importance of sustainable investments for the stability of the global financial system.

"He threatened to quit the Premier League club within 24 hours if the name change bid failed, and the Football Association turned it down in April. However, it seems that the controversial move may still be on the cards.

The St David's Day Agreement said the vote would be an ""expectation,"" and Labour's Welsh ministers oppose holding a referendum before a funding agreement is reached. Labour accused the Conservatives of trying to coerce them. The manifesto details that the Conservatives would ""introduce a 'funding floor' to protect Wales' funding relative to others and to provide certainty for Welsh Government planning once a referendum on Income Tax powers is called in the next Parliament."" Yet, a Welsh Conservative spokesperson told BBC Wales that ""the St David's Day commitment to a funding floor for Wales is clear and firm, with efforts already underway at the Treasury and Wales Office."" They emphasized, ""The funding floor for Wales isn't contingent on an income tax referendum, and the UK manifesto expects a referendum on income tax raising powers to be held early in the next term by the Welsh Assembly."""

These customers were often stuck in a cycle of minimum repayments, which barely covered the interest, let alone made a dent in the principal amount.

"Julia Knight, 56, denies attempting to murder Irene Robson, 81, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014, but admits to administering a harmful substance with intent to endanger life. The trial began yesterday at the Oxford Crown Court, where shocking details of the case were revealed.

Julia Knight, a 56-year-old nurse, stood accused of attempting to murder Irene Robson, an 81-year-old patient, at Horton Hospital in Banbury in October 2014. In a surprising twist, Knight admitted to administering a harmful substance but firmly denied any intention to murder Robson.

The prosecution alleged that Knight had deliberately administered a lethal dose of medication to Robson, leading to her deteriorating health and subsequent near-death experience. They argued that Knight had harbored a grudge against Robson, although the details surrounding this alleged motive remain unclear.

During the trial's opening statements, the defense acknowledged Knight's administration of the substance but emphasized that there was no intent to kill Robson. Instead, they claimed that Knight had made an error in judgment, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

Though B negative is only in 2% of Britain’s population, hospital usage has risen by 6% over the past four weeks compared to last year. B negative is valuable as it can serve both B negative and B positive people."

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales are taking part in a pilot scheme following the study. Coercive or controlling behaviour became a criminal offence last year. The research found that although most domestic abuse incidents were handled in a ""professional"" way, some officers still displayed ""negative and uninformed"" attitudes. In particular, police tended to neglect cases where suspects did not use violence but tried to control their victim in other ways such as by making threats. The report said: ""A tendency for the police to focus on physical violence and what has occurred at the current incident can result in them missing abuse which is characterised not by physical violence and injury but by continuous coercion and control in other forms."" The researchers concluded that if risk was not assessed properly some cases would ""slip through the net"".

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea University, and a number of other partners, collaborating to develop buildings that can generate and store their own renewable energy.

The aim of this innovative concept is to create self-sustaining buildings that can produce and store enough energy to meet their own needs, and even contribute excess energy back to the grid. This would not only reduce reliance on traditional energy sources but also help in tackling climate change.

The project aims to integrate cutting-edge technology, such as solar panels and energy storage systems, into the fabric of the buildings. This means that the buildings themselves become power stations, harnessing energy from the sun and converting it into electricity, without compromising on their aesthetics and functionality.

If successfully implemented, this revolutionary idea could have a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed in the future. It could lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a more sustainable and resilient energy system, and ultimately, a cleaner and greener environment.

"Unemployment fell to 1.69 million between January and March, down 2,000 from the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, according to the latest data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This figure indicates that the UK's job market has remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit.

The ONS also revealed that the number of people in employment rose by 99,000 during the same period, reaching a record high of 32.7 million. This suggests that businesses are still hiring and expanding despite concerns about the country's future relationship with the European Union.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said. Mr Carney said the issuance of green bonds - for example, to help finance water or renewable power projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions - could double in 2016 from last year's $42bn.

"These beautiful pictures are the first ever taken of a wild lioness nursing a cub from a different species - an extremely rare event. The pair were captured on camera by wildlife photographer, John Smith, in the heart of the African savannah. These astonishing images showcase the extraordinary bond between the lioness and the tiny cheetah cub.

This unlikely union has astounded experts, as inter-species nursing is virtually unheard of in the wild. The lioness, known as Maya, was spotted adopting the orphaned cheetah cub when it wandered into her pride's territory.

Maya's maternal instinct kicked in, and she graciously accepted the cub as her own, providing it with nourishment and protection alongside her own lion cubs. This act of compassion has left researchers baffled, as lions are known to be fiercely territorial and typically eliminate any potential threats.

Conservationists are hopeful that these unprecedented images will shed light on the intricate social behavior of wild animals and inspire further research into interspecies compassion. They believe that Maya's extraordinary act may be a testament to the universal instinct of motherhood that transcends species boundaries.

"England have been hit by injuries in the back row, with James Haskell, Sam Jones and Mike Williams all ruled out, along with the versatile forward, Joe Launchbury. This comes as a major blow to England's preparations for the upcoming Six Nations tournament.

James Haskell, a seasoned campaigner, has been a vital figure in England's back row for years. His experience and physicality will be sorely missed. Sam Jones, an emerging talent, was also expected to make a significant impact. His absence leaves a void in England's options.

"Research for the College of Policing suggested that officers were focusing on cases involving violence and overlooking other risk factors. Three unnamed police forces in England and Wales were found to prioritize cases involving violence, while potentially neglecting other crucial risk factors, according to research conducted for the College of Policing. The study highlighted concerns over the narrow focus of police officers, potentially leaving other vulnerable individuals at risk.

It found that officers were dedicating a significant amount of time and resources to cases involving violence, while other risk factors such as mental health issues, substance abuse, and domestic disputes were receiving less attention.

Dr. Sarah Cooper, the lead researcher of the study, emphasized the importance of a more holistic approach in policing. She argued that by solely focusing on violent cases, officers may be missing opportunities to intervene and prevent harm in other areas of vulnerability.

"Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea last week after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed. Ports have refused to accept Hanjin vessels, leaving hundreds of ships and billions of dollars worth of cargo stranded at sea.

The South Korean shipping giant's financial troubles have sent shockwaves throughout the global shipping industry. As the seventh largest container carrier in the world, Hanjin's bankruptcy has disrupted supply chains and left companies scrambling to find alternative shipping options.

The refusal by ports to accept Hanjin ships stems from fears that they will not be paid for their services, as the company's assets have been frozen. This has caused a domino effect, leading to congestion at ports and delays in the delivery of goods.

The situation has prompted governments and industry regulators to step in and find solutions to the crisis. South Korea has pledged $90 million to help alleviate the immediate impact, while other countries have also offered financial support.

China's government blames Uighur militants for recent violent incidents, though activists say such violence is driven by Chinese repression. Traditionally, Uighurs practice moderate Islam, but recent stricter influences from the Gulf and Pakistan have led to more women wearing face coverings. BBC Asia Pacific editor Charles Scanlon commented that Chinese officials view Islamic face veils as acts of defiance in a period of increasing regional violence. Additionally, in August, Karamay city prohibited men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe these restrictions may cause backlash given the perception among many Uighurs that their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an ethnic policy expert from La Trobe University in Melbourne, provided information on this issue to Reuters."

After serving an eviction notice to the group in Lowestoft on Friday afternoon due to several disturbances, Suffolk officers told Norfolk colleagues. Norfolk confirmed knowledge but stated there was no intelligence about the group's destination. On Friday, a teenage woman was raped at a bus stop on Cadogan Road near the water.
